# Current State

Last updated: 2026-05-31 20:00:00 UTC (2026-05-31 14:00:00 MDT)

## Active Architecture: v7.0

Self-Documenting, Self-Assessing, Self-Recovering Infrastructure Platform.
  k3s + Flux CD + Proxmox + four intelligence layers.
  See ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE-REVIEW-v7.md for full detail.
Seventeen-state model. Six-layer lifecycle. Three assessment tiers. Five dependency graphs.


## Next Action

**Implement Milestone 7.4 — Recovery Documentation Update (Service Layer).**
Add service contract validation steps, service health check commands (from
contract `health_check` field), service restart/verification commands, and
distinct rendering of Service Contract dependency edges in the recovery runbook.
See ROADMAP.md Milestone 7.4 for the full spec.

## Architecture Gaps (v4.0 items not yet implemented)

| Gap | Phase | Impact on Reconstruction |
|---|---|---|
| Bootstrap State schema | 6.1 | Cannot track Cloud-Init, templates, provenance |
| Cloud-Init templates | 6.2 | First-boot provisioning not replayable |
| Secret Registry | 6.3 | Recovery commands have `[KEEPASS_PATH]` placeholders |
| DNS Registry | 6.4 | Recovery commands have `[VM_IP]` placeholders |
| Deployment Provenance | 6.5 | Cannot verify reconstruction matches original |
| Template Registry | 6.6 | Base images not tracked, template rebuild not automated |
| Service Contracts | 7.1 | Dependencies use heuristics, not declared contracts |
| Service State schema | 7.2 | Service layer not modeled in recovery documentation |
| Network topology as code | 8.x | Wave 0 network reconstruction requires manual steps |
| Reconstruction Playbooks | 9.x | No executable reconstruction scripts |
| Operational Documentation | 10.x | No drift/capacity/health documentation class |
| Capacity Model | 11.x | Recovery readiness does not validate resource headroom |

## New Codebase Layout (doc-gen architecture)

```
assessment/tier1/       Tier 1 bootstrap assessment package
data-model/             7 JSON schemas + stdlib validator (90 tests passing)
doc-gen/                Documentation generation engine
  engine.py             CLI: --mode bootstrap | recovery (+ drift integration)
  analyzers.py          10 DERIVED field analyzers
  dependencies.py       Dependency graph + topological sort
  drift.py              Field-level manifest diff and drift detector
  readiness.py          GREEN/YELLOW/ORANGE/RED/BLOCKED scorer
  readiness_report.py   Standalone Readiness-Report.md + .json
  renderers/            ODS and ODT generators (stdlib only)
history/                Snapshot store
  index.py              Snapshot index builder CLI
  index.json            Snapshot index (auto-generated)
  snapshots/            Historical manifest snapshots (2 entries)
docs/                   Architecture docs and session handoff
reports/                Generated documentation output
tests/unit/             110 tests (schema, analyze, readiness, drift, reproducibility)
tests/fixtures/         Sample manifests for tier1 and tier2
```

## Legacy Codebase Layout (pae CLI — do not delete)

```
engine/         Original assessment engine and CLI
collector/      Original collector framework
schemas/        Original JSON schemas (assessment.schema.json etc.)
tests/          Original 286 tests for legacy codebase
pyproject.toml  Package definition for pae CLI
```

## Key Design Constraints

- analyze.py and validate.py: Python 3 stdlib only (no pip)
- ODS/ODT renderers: zipfile + XML only (no odfpy)
- doc-gen: runs without network access (all data from manifest)
- UNRESOLVED fields: never silently omitted
- Historical snapshots: reproducible (same manifest → same docs)
