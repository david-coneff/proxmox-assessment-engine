# Project Resume Block — broodforge

Instance of [PAP-State §3](../modules/PAP-State/PAP-State.md#3-project-resume-block)
(Project Resume Block), conforming to
[`resume-block.schema.yaml`](../modules/PAP-State/schemas/resume-block.schema.yaml).
This is **broodforge's own** resume block — a record of *broodforge's
codebase-development continuity*, governed going forward by PAP per
[`pap/revisions/2026-06-07_session-continuity-transition-to-pap.md`](../revisions/2026-06-07_session-continuity-transition-to-pap.md).
It is not, and does not describe, broodforge's *infrastructure remediation*
function (planner/queue/executor/policy) — that is the platform's product
behavior, not its development process, and is out of scope for this artifact
(see that transition record's "What this transition is — and is not" section).

---

- **project_identity**: Broodforge — a self-managing infrastructure platform
  for home-lab Proxmox + k3s environments (hardware assessment, cell forging,
  node spawning, phoenix recovery, continuous health monitoring, autonomous
  remediation). Six-layer lifecycle, seventeen-state model, three assessment
  tiers, five dependency-graph types. Architecture v7.1+. (Source:
  `.ai/context.md`, `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`.)

- **active_objective**: Phase 1.M (Dynamic Analysis Self-Audit Integration, AD-063)
  now **fully implemented and committed** (2026-06-09). Extends Phase 1.L (AD-062) with
  dynamic analysis: `DynamicHealthScore` dataclass + `assess_dynamic_health()` in
  `continuous_assessment.py`; dynamic health subcard in `broodforge_dashboard.py`; deal
  contracts on `build_spawn_plan`/`build_derived_vault_plan`/`score_component`; beartype
  in `conftest.py`; hypothesis property tests in test_spawn_planner/test_vault_hierarchy/
  test_readiness; `tests/bash/forge_phase_test.bats`; `tests/fuzz/` atheris targets;
  html_base.py synced. 51 new tests. Full suite: **4476 passed, 16 skipped**.
  All prior phases also done through 1.L. No further proposed development phases in
  `ROADMAP.md`. Next operational action: **deploy to hardware**.

- **active_milestone**: (Updated — fourteenth milestone, 2026-06-09 Phase 1.M implementation.)
  Phase 1.M (Dynamic Analysis Self-Audit Integration, AD-063) complete:
  - Step 1: `DynamicHealthScore` dataclass + `assess_dynamic_health()` in `continuous_assessment.py` (section 24.9). Removed duplicate conflicting class definition from interrupted prior session. Fixed hypothesis failures parser (comma-stripping) and `no_infra` check (mutmut availability excluded).
  - Step 2: `_build_dynamic_health_subcard()` + `_code_health_to_remediation_candidates()` updated in `broodforge_dashboard.py` to use correct field names; `not_implemented` state handled.
  - Step 3: deal contracts on `build_spawn_plan()`, `build_derived_vault_plan()`, `score_component()`.
  - Step 4: beartype wired in `conftest.py`.
  - Step 5: `pyproject.toml` dev deps + `[tool.mutmut]` config.
  - Step 6: Hypothesis property tests in test_spawn_planner, test_vault_hierarchy, test_readiness.
  - Step 7: `tests/bash/forge_phase_test.bats` + `tests/fuzz/fuzz_manifest.py` + `tests/fuzz/fuzz_spawn_planner.py`.
  - Step 8: `html_base.py` synced (proxmox-bootstrap ↔ doc-gen/renderers).
  - Step 9: State docs updated (ROADMAP.md Phase 1.L implemented + 1.M added, ARCHITECTURE.md AD-063, FEATURE-HISTORY.md, CURRENT_STATE.md, RESUME_BLOCK.md).
  Full suite: **4476 passed, 16 skipped**.

  (Previous — thirteenth milestone, 2026-06-08 Phase 1.L implementation.)
  Phase 1.L (Static Analysis Self-Audit Integration) complete:
  - Step 0: PAP Audit-Reasoning-Patterns.md synced (37 patterns, from 6).
  - Step 1: ROADMAP.md Phase 1.L section + ARCHITECTURE.md AD-062 added.
  - Step 2: `tools/run-static-audit.sh` (Tier 1 standalone audit script).
  - Step 3: `pyproject.toml` updated; `tests/static/test_shellcheck.py` (Tier 2).
  - Step 4: `assess_code_health()` + `CodeHealthScore` in `continuous_assessment.py`;
    Code Health card in `broodforge_dashboard.py` (Tier 3).
  - Step 5: `tests/test_code_health.py` — 33 unit tests.
  - Step 6: State docs updated (FEATURE-HISTORY.md, CURRENT_STATE.md, RESUME_BLOCK.md).
  Full suite: **4425 passed, 1 skipped**.

  (Previous — twelfth milestone, 2026-06-08 PAP audit rounds 3 and 4.)
  PAP audit R3 (`commits 39fb05a, 51b39b8`) and R4 (`commit 45403fb`) — 5 findings resolved:
  - R3-001 (HIGH): Phase-08 now exits 2 (NOT_IMPLEMENTED) when k3s is absent — FORGE_INCOMPLETE
    banner reachable in standard forge run (same N-002 pattern, phase-08 was the remaining blocker).
  - R3-004 (HIGH/latent): `forge-keepass-gate.sh` now persists password + kdbx path to 0600 tmpfs
    session file; phases 05 and 06 call `forge_keepass_gate` before `kdbx_get`; `forge.sh` cleans
    up via EXIT trap. Fixes the "operator added credentials but forge still loops" scenario.
  - R3-002 (LOW): `headscale preauthkeys create` command corrected in `spawn-planner.py` and
    `federated_reconstruction.py` (was deprecated `authkeys generate`).
  - R3-003 (LOW): Stale comment referencing non-existent function removed from `spawn_scripts.py`.
  - R4-001 (MEDIUM): Session file now stores `FORGE_KDBX_PATH` on line 1 alongside the password —
    R3-004 fix was incomplete without this; `kdbx_get` would still fail with empty database path.
  12 new tests. Full suite: **4415 passed, 1 skipped**. All roadmap items complete.
  Next action: **deploy to hardware**.

  (Previous — eleventh milestone, 2026-06-08 PAP audit round 2.)
  4 new findings from `.ai/pap-audit-2026-06-08-r2.md` resolved:
  - N-001 (HIGH): phase-05 `export _worker_token`/`_server_token` before heredoc — fixes
    `KeyError` that prevented k3s tokens ever being written to `bootstrap-state.json`.
  - N-002 (HIGH): phase-06 exits 2 (NOT_IMPLEMENTED) not 1 when credentials missing —
    FORGE_INCOMPLETE banner is now reachable in a standard forge run.
  - N-003 (MEDIUM): `NODE-SPAWNING.md` "WAN mode prerequisites" section added with full
    Headscale/Tailscale checklist.
  - N-004 (MEDIUM): `generate-bootstrap-image.py` wired to `build_pregenerated_spawn_media_record`
    + `record_pending_join_authorization` via new `--state` flag — Phase 1.J authorization
    pipeline end-to-end operational.
  15 new tests. Full suite: **4403 passed, 1 skipped**. All roadmap items complete.
  Next action: **deploy to hardware**.

  (Previous — tenth milestone, 2026-06-08 PAP audit.) All 34 PAP
  audit findings (`.ai/pap-audit-2026-06-08.md`) resolved across CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
  severity. Commits 31a2ee6 (CRITICAL), 1195e8f (HIGH), and this commit (MEDIUM/LOW).
  Test suite: 4332 passed, 1 skipped. All roadmap items remain complete.
  Next action: **deploy to hardware**.

  **Before this (ninth milestone, 2026-06-08):** All four
  proposed phases are now implemented, committed, and pushed. The ninth
  milestone closes the complete implementation run:
  - Phase 1.J (AD-060, commit f883540): Hypervisor Recovery — Constrained
    Accounts + Pre-Generated Spawn Media. Confirmed already committed by
    the previous session; PAP state was written but not committed at that
    time. This session: verified implementation files exist and are correct,
    updated PAP state to close the "commit pending" flag.
  - Image Builder GUI (Phase 1.H addition, AD-057): `forge-image-builder.html`
    — self-contained cross-platform wizard wrapping `generate-bootstrap-image.py`,
    offline-first, dark/light theme, live command preview + clipboard copy.
    No server required. AD-057 updated to reflect Phase 1.H fully
    implemented + GUI added. ROADMAP.md Phase 1.H/1.I/1.J/1.K headings
    updated from "proposed" to "implemented (commit X)"; all Phase 1.H
    scope checklist items marked `[x]`. FEATURE-HISTORY.md/`.html` updated.
    ROADMAP.html regenerated. Full suite: 4388 passed, 1 skipped (unchanged
    — no Python code touched this milestone).

  **Before this (sixth milestone, same day, earlier session):** Resumed per
  the operator's "continue using PAP-state" instruction; found a
  prior session had left the AD-058 guided-setup gap (named at the end of the
  fifth milestone, below) **mid-flight as uncommitted edits** — completed it:
  `security.mfa_method` is now wired end-to-end, **guided setup → forge
  manifest → `KeePassInitConfig`** (`guided_setup.py` suggest/check_conflicts,
  `forge_planner.py build_forge_manifest()`, `forge_keepass_init.py
  generate_keepass_init_config()` — the last of which had computed the value
  but never passed it to the returned config; that one missing line was the
  whole remaining gap). Added full test coverage
  (`test_guided_setup.py`/`test_forge_planner.py`, 6 new cases). While running
  the full suite to verify (standing practice before declaring done), found
  **one pre-existing failure unrelated to this work** —
  `test_phase19_federation.py::test_expiring_soon_still_valid` — confirmed via
  `git stash` it failed identically on untouched `main` (not a regression):
  `verify_trust()` in `federation_state.py` compared a real-wall-clock
  property (`relationship.is_expired` → `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`) against
  its own injected `now_fn`, so a fixture pinned to "now = 2026-06-01" with
  expiry "2026-06-08" started failing the moment real UTC crossed that date.
  Fixed it to compare against the injected `now` consistently (mirroring the
  correct pattern already used two lines below it for re-verification age).
  Recorded the full cycle in `docs/FEATURE-HISTORY.md`
  (`2026-06-08_12_36_41 UTC`) and regenerated its HTML twin. **Full suite:
  3844 passed** (was 3843 + 1 pre-existing failure — both now green, no
  regressions). See `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`'s `last_completed_step` for the
  complete account, including the named-but-deliberately-not-chased
  `datetime.now(`/`datetime.utcnow(` sweep candidate this surfaced.

  **Before this (fifth milestone, prior session, same day):** The
  operator reacted to the "Hypervisor Recovery Credentials" sketch
  (endorsing its constrained-recovery-account "middle path") and, in the
  same message, issued two further direct instructions, both now closed:
  (1) **AD-058** — second-factor auth (TOTP-authenticator or YubiKey only,
  *never* SMS/email) is now the **default**, not opt-in, for the KeePass
  unlock gate (`KeePassInitConfig.mfa_method` / `--mfa` flipped `"none"` →
  `"totp"`; the mechanism — `keepass_mfa.py` — already existed, fully
  tested, and already excluded SMS/email by design; only the *default* and
  documentation needed to change); one gap is named and deliberately left
  open — `guided_setup.py`/`forge_planner.py` don't yet prompt for MFA
  interactively. (2) `ROADMAP.html` (and, finding similar drift,
  `docs/FEATURE-HISTORY.html`) **regenerated** via
  `md_to_html.py --collapsible` — satisfying the operator's "revise the
  roadmap to use collapsible sections, it's quite lengthy" request *and*
  closing a content-drift gap worse than the one the prior milestone's new
  `test_meta_doc_sync.py` checks for (that test compares date stamps only;
  the hand-synced `ROADMAP.html` was actually missing entire `<h3>`
  sections that exist in `ROADMAP.md` — true regeneration fixes content
  drift, not just stamp drift). Both changes, plus AD-058's stamp-sync
  follow-through in `ARCHITECTURE.md`/`docs/ARCHITECTURE.html`, are recorded
  in a new dated cycle in `docs/FEATURE-HISTORY.md`
  (`2026-06-08_04_54_51 UTC`). All tests green
  (`test_meta_doc_sync.py`, `test_html_base_sync.py`, and the
  `keepass or mfa or forge_init or secrets or meta_doc or html_base or
  roadmap or feature_history` sweep — 156 passed). The three draft sketches
  from the fourth milestone (Recovery-Readiness Conformance, Hypervisor
  Recovery Credentials, Granular Secret Access Silos) remain in
  `ROADMAP.md` "Proposed Future Work," still awaiting promotion to
  phase/AD status. The intelligence/development side of the project remains
  feature-complete per its own governance corpus; the next milestone named
  in that corpus is an *operational* one (a real hardware run), not a
  development one — though `ROADMAP.md` now also names one *proposed*
  development item (Phase 1.H), three *draft* items (the sketches above),
  and one newly-named *gap* (AD-058's guided-setup MFA prompt) for whenever
  the operator chooses to engage with any of them.

- **active_risks**:
  - **(Updated 2026-06-07, second milestone — F1 and F2 now CLOSED):** The
    `pap`-driven audit recorded in
    [`pap/audits/2026-06-07_broodforge-pap-audit.md`](../audits/2026-06-07_broodforge-pap-audit.md)
    originally named three open, non-blocking findings. Two are now resolved
    by direct operator clarification of original intent, recorded as in-place
    annotations (nothing silently rewritten — originals preserved):
    - ~~F1 (Charter Purpose/SHALL-NOT text reads as broader than the system
      that exists)~~ — **CLOSED**. The operator clarified the SHALL-NOT
      list's "subjective judgments"/"recommendations" language always meant
      *specific-hardware* recommendations (product/pricing-database-grade
      calls, out of scope), not the platform's own resource-provisioning /
      deployment-strategy decisions for infrastructure it manages. Recorded
      as an in-place Scope note on `.ai/PROJECT_CHARTER.md` and `AD-040`.
    - ~~F2 (AD-034's "never takes autonomous action" boundary reads as
      crossed by Phase 26, with no decision record marking the crossing)~~ —
      **CLOSED**. The operator clarified autonomous action was always meant
      to be acceptable *when bounded by safeguards and recoverability* —
      AD-034's phrasing was under-specified, not the system's behavior wrong.
      Recorded as an in-place Amendment on `AD-034` and `AD-040`.
    - Both were genuine **textual ambiguities**, not real contradictions
      between governing text and built system — resolvable only by the
      documents' own author stating original intent, exactly as the audit's
      own Falsification perspective had hedged might be the case. See
      `pap/state/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`'s `key_decisions_and_insights` for the
      fuller account, and the audit record's own "Status update" banner and
      per-finding "Resolution" annotations for the canonical record.
  - **F3 — initially deferred, now CLOSED.** The untracked `new/` directory
    (~165 proposed-revision documents, not ~25 — the smaller count was an
    early estimate from filenames alone) was first explicitly deferred by
    the operator ("this is deferred for the moment"), then **explicitly
    un-deferred** by a later, separate, scoped instruction ("Analyze the
    `new/` directory ... and integrate relevant content into the roadmap and
    architecture" — with built-in guidance on what to integrate vs. defer).
    That analysis is done: **one** concrete, additive item was integrated
    (proposed **Phase 1.H — Pre-Install Forge Package and Image Builder**,
    in `ROADMAP.md` + `ARCHITECTURE.md` AD-057); three other named areas were
    checked and found already implemented; the rest — federation/
    civilization/century-scale specs and a parallel "RFC-graph
    self-governance" architecture series plus a formal axiomatic-kernel proof
    series — was explicitly named and deferred as out of scope for
    broodforge's actual product. See `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`'s third
    `milestone_checklist` block and the audit's F3 "Resolution" annotation
    for the full record. **Do not re-run this analysis** — read its output.
  - **(Added 2026-06-07, follow-up to F3 closure — now CLOSED, 2026-06-08,
    seventh milestone):** The operator partially walked back the formal
    axiomatic-kernel deferral above — not asking to implement it, but
    observing that beneath its category-theoretic framing it names two real
    concerns (provable recovery readiness; observed-state ↔ intent-manifest
    conformance) and asking for a draft of "what to do with these." A
    **DRAFT SKETCH** ("Recovery-Readiness Conformance") was written into
    `ROADMAP.md`'s "Proposed Future Work" section: a translation table
    mapping each formal construct to the broodforge mechanism that already
    plays its role informally, plus identification of **one** genuinely new
    artifact worth scoping further (a `recovery-readiness-certificate.json`
    composing existing scores/hashes/drill results). **The operator reacted
    on 2026-06-08** — "Recovery-Readiness Conformance → Scope as Phase 1.I"
    — and the sketch is now **Phase 1.I** (AD-059), promoted in place with
    the translation table preserved as supporting analysis. This thread is
    closed; no further reaction is awaited on this item.
  - F4 (an OBSERVATION, not a finding requiring action) stands as recorded —
    see the audit's status banner.
  - One deferred technical item from the prior (now-superseded)
    `docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`: "(A1) sys.path coupling in html workbooks +
    collect_tier2 that import from doc-gen/renderers via sys.path.insert —
    requires package restructure into a proper Python package. Low urgency —
    works correctly today."

- **blockers**: None known. (No BLOCKER-classified finding exists in the most
  recent PAP-AUDIT of broodforge; broodforge's own `docs/AUDIT-FINDINGS.md`
  cycles likewise show no open blocking item as of the last entry.)

- **next_action**: **(Updated — fourteenth milestone closed, 2026-06-09.)**
  Phase 1.M (Dynamic Analysis Self-Audit Integration, AD-063) complete. Full suite:
  **4476 passed, 16 skipped** (4 pre-existing `test_opentofu.py` failures unchanged).
  **Next operational action**: deploy to hardware — run `python3
  proxmox-bootstrap/forge-planner.py` on a real Proxmox host to forge the
  first cell. See `FORGING.md`.

  If the operator gives new direction on any future work, pick it up, scope it
  precisely to what was asked, write the cycle into `docs/FEATURE-HISTORY.md`,
  and update this corpus again.

## Provenance

Created as part of
[`pap/revisions/2026-06-07_session-continuity-transition-to-pap.md`](../revisions/2026-06-07_session-continuity-transition-to-pap.md) —
the transition that moved broodforge's own session-continuity practice from
its pre-PAP prototype mechanisms (`.ai/AI_AGENT_BOOTSTRAP.md`,
`docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`) onto PAP-State's formally-specified Resume Block
and Session Handoff Protocol. Update this block at minimum at every session
boundary and at every major milestone, per the schema's `update_trigger`.
