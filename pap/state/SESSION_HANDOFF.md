# Session Handoff — broodforge

Instance of [PAP-State §4](../modules/PAP-State/PAP-State.md#4-session-handoff-protocol)
(Session Handoff Protocol), conforming in shape to
[`session-handoff.schema.yaml`](../modules/PAP-State/schemas/session-handoff.schema.yaml).
This is **broodforge's own** session-handoff artifact — the durable,
self-contained "what a cold reader needs to resume broodforge's
codebase-development work" record, now governed by PAP per
[`pap/revisions/2026-06-07_session-continuity-transition-to-pap.md`](../revisions/2026-06-07_session-continuity-transition-to-pap.md),
which also explains *why* this artifact now exists here rather than at
`docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md` (its pre-PAP, now-superseded predecessor — moved,
not deleted, to `docs/deprecated/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`, with full prior-session
history intact and recoverable).

**On scope**: this handoff concerns broodforge's own *development* continuity
— the "revision protocol for the codebase itself" the operator named when
commissioning this transition. It is not, and must not become, a record of
broodforge's *infrastructure-remediation* operations (the planner → queue →
executor → policy loop the platform runs against the systems it manages) —
that is the platform's product behavior, governed by its own operational
artifacts (`bootstrap-state.json`, `FORGING.md`, the dashboard, etc.), not by
this development-side ledger. Keeping that line visible here is itself part
of what this transition exists to make durable.

---

- **status**: IDLE — no active codebase-development session. All roadmap
  milestones and intelligence tracks are complete per `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`
  / `.ai/NEXT_STEPS.md`; the platform's own next named action is operational
  ("deploy to hardware"), not developmental. One *proposed* (not-started)
  development item now exists — Phase 1.H, see below. **Updated same day**
  (this artifact's own `update_trigger` — PAP-State §3/§4 — fired at the
  third milestone described below).

- **objective**: None currently active. Three threads have completed since
  this file was first written: (1) the continuity-transition this file is the
  centerpiece of (see `milestone_checklist`'s first six items, all `[x]`);
  (2) **resolving PAP-AUDIT findings F1 and F2**; and (3), **the `new/`
  corpus analysis (F3)** — initially deferred, then explicitly un-deferred by
  direct operator instruction ("Analyze the `new/` directory ... and
  integrate relevant content into the roadmap and architecture"). See the
  new `milestone_checklist` entries and `key_decisions_and_insights` below.
  Before all three: the last active development objective (per the
  now-superseded `docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`'s final entry) was a "deep
  architecture-vs-docs audit + interactive HTML" pass, completed and closed
  with "4000 passed, 1 skipped (Windows-only). No regressions."

- **source_materials** (what a resuming agent should read, and why):
  - [`pap/state/RESUME_BLOCK.md`](RESUME_BLOCK.md) — the current portable
    save-state this handoff carries (see `resume_block_ref`, below);
    read it first.
  - [`pap/audits/2026-06-07_broodforge-pap-audit.md`](../audits/2026-06-07_broodforge-pap-audit.md) —
    **updated same day**: F1 and F2 are now closed (in-place "Resolution"
    annotations on each finding, plus a status banner near the top of the
    file); F3 remains open and explicitly deferred by the operator; F4
    (an OBSERVATION) stands as recorded. Read the status banner first.
  - `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `.ai/NEXT_STEPS.md`, `.ai/decisions.md`,
    `.ai/context.md` — broodforge's own canonical governance/continuity
    corpus; still its own sovereign authority (PAP does not supersede it —
    `PAP_CHARTER.md` §2.3).
  - `docs/deprecated/SESSION-HANDOFF.md` — the full pre-transition session
    history (1142 lines: "Previous Session Work," "Remaining Work,"
    "Previous Sessions," test-count history, architecture notes). Preserved
    in full, moved (not deleted) — read it for *historical* development
    context; do not extend it further (extend this file instead).
  - `new/claude prompt.txt` and the ~165 chapter/spec/RFC documents alongside
    it — **no longer a deferred corpus (F3 is now CLOSED)**. The operator
    explicitly un-deferred this and commissioned its analysis ("Analyze the
    `new/` directory ... and integrate relevant content into the roadmap and
    architecture"). The analysis is done: see `ROADMAP.md`'s "Proposed Future
    Work — from `new/` corpus analysis" section (Phase 1.H — Pre-Install
    Forge Package and Image Builder, the one concrete item integrated, plus
    "What was reviewed and found already covered" and "What was deferred and
    why" — the latter explaining, by name, why the bulk of the corpus
    — federation/civilization/century-scale specs, the RFC-graph
    self-governance series, and the formal axiomatic-kernel proof series —
    stays out of scope), `ARCHITECTURE.md` AD-057, and this audit's F3
    "Resolution" annotation. **Do not re-run that analysis** — read its
    output instead; if something looks missed, that is a finding to record
    against the existing analysis, not grounds to redo it from scratch.

- **key_decisions_and_insights** (conclusions already reached — do not
  re-derive):
  - Broodforge's pre-PAP session-continuity mechanisms
    (`.ai/AI_AGENT_BOOTSTRAP.md`'s "read in this order" bootstrap and
    `docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`'s rolling session log) were genuine, working
    *prototypes* of exactly what PAP-State §1/§3/§4 now formally specify —
    not mistakes, and not to be treated as such. `docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`'s
    own "M3" entry shows broodforge's maintainers had *already* once
    deduplicated a stray copy (`.ai/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`, "stale duplicate")
    — direct evidence the underlying continuity-tracking *need* was real and
    recurring well before PAP arrived to formalize it.
  - This transition does **not** put broodforge "under PAP governance" in
    the constitutional sense — `.ai/PROJECT_CHARTER.md` remains broodforge's
    sovereign top-level authority (`PAP_CHARTER.md` §2.3, `pap/README.md`).
    What transitions is narrower and more concrete: the specific *mechanism*
    broodforge's own maintainers use to track and hand off codebase-
    development continuity, by direct operator instruction, because PAP's
    formal version of that mechanism is now available and superior in
    exactly the ways a prototype is normally superseded by a matured form
    of the same idea (named shape, machine-form schema, explicit
    update-triggers, a Resume Block it doesn't redefine but points to).
  - "Broodforge's own revision protocol for its codebase" is explicitly
    **not** the same thing as "broodforge's remediation process for failing
    nodes and the general functions it performs" — the operator drew this
    line explicitly when commissioning this transition, and it is the single
    most important distinction this artifact and its sibling `RESUME_BLOCK.md`
    exist to keep visible to a future cold reader.
  - **(Added same day, second milestone) F1 and F2 were textual ambiguities,
    not real contradictions** — both dissolved the moment broodforge's
    operator (the Charter's and the Decision Record's own author) supplied
    the original-intent definitions neither document had recorded: the
    Charter's "no subjective judgments / recommendations" language named
    *specific-hardware* recommendations only (not the platform's own
    deployment-strategy decisions), and AD-034's "never takes autonomous
    action" was always meant to read "...without defined safeguards and
    recoverability." Recorded as in-place annotations (Charter Scope note,
    AD-034 Amendment, AD-040, audit Resolution notes) — **originals preserved,
    nothing silently rewritten**. Do not re-litigate either question; both
    are closed, by the only authority able to close them.
  - This is a concrete, worked example of something `pap/audits/2026-06-07_broodforge-pap-audit.md`'s
    own APDRP review anticipated in the abstract (its Falsification
    perspective named "if 'subjective judgment' were defined elsewhere in a
    narrower sense, this finding would dissolve" as the one thing that would
    undo F1) and could not, by itself, resolve — some questions an audit can
    only frame; only the artifact's author can answer them. Worth remembering
    the next time a finding's resolution looks like it depends on intent
    rather than evidence: name that plainly, and ask, rather than guess.
  - **(Added same day, third milestone) F3 — "deferred" was a snapshot of
    operator intent at a moment in time, not a permanent classification.**
    The same operator who said "this is deferred for the moment" later, in
    a separate instruction, explicitly un-deferred it — *with* scoping
    guidance baked into the instruction itself ("some sections get into
    highly speculative, philosophical territory... do NOT deeply integrate
    or analyze those — defer them. Focus only on items that have a realistic
    software implementation path"). The resulting analysis found the ~165
    document corpus to be overwhelmingly *not* about broodforge's actual
    product (a Proxmox/k3s home-lab platform) — most of it describes either
    governing the specification corpus itself (a parallel "RFC graph"
    self-governance architecture: Coherence Ledger, Master Control Plane,
    Orchestration Kernel, etc.) or multi-generational/civilizational
    continuity concerns at a scale far beyond broodforge's charter. Exactly
    **one** concretely implementable, additive idea surfaced cleanly: a
    pre-install "Image Builder" that closes the gap between "operator already
    has Proxmox installed" (today's only path) and "bare metal, nothing
    installed yet" (what Chapter 16/Spec 70/148 name as the unsolved case) —
    recorded as proposed Phase 1.H. Three other named areas (documentation
    engine, runbook generation, UI/visualization) were checked against the
    existing codebase and found *already* substantially implemented — a
    useful confirmation that broodforge's own independent design arrived at
    similar conclusions to this corpus on the parts that actually overlap.
    Don't re-derive any of this; read `ROADMAP.md`'s "Proposed Future Work"
    section and `ARCHITECTURE.md` AD-057 for the full record.

- **milestone_checklist**:
  - [x] Identify broodforge's pre-PAP session-continuity prototype mechanisms
        (`.ai/AI_AGENT_BOOTSTRAP.md`, `docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`) and confirm
        neither had crept into `.ai/PROJECT_CHARTER.md` itself (it had not —
        the charter is 269 bytes, four Purpose/SHALL/SHALL-NOT lines, no
        mention of either mechanism).
  - [x] Instantiate PAP-State's formal replacements in broodforge's own
        (previously-empty) `pap/state/`: this file and `RESUME_BLOCK.md`.
  - [x] Move (not delete) `docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md` to
        `docs/deprecated/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`, preserving its full session
        history and git lineage (`git mv`), with an in-place banner pointing
        forward to this file.
  - [x] Rewrite `.ai/AI_AGENT_BOOTSTRAP.md`'s "read in this order" / "then"
        steps to route through PAP's Startup Protocol and this file, instead
        of the retired `docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`.
  - [x] Repoint `README.md`'s "latest session context" pointer to this file.
  - [x] Record the transition as a Decision Record in broodforge's own
        `.ai/decisions.md` (AD-039) — so a reader of broodforge's governance
        corpus *alone*, with no knowledge of `pap/`, can still discover that
        and why this changed.
  - [x] Write the full transition record in
        [`pap/revisions/2026-06-07_session-continuity-transition-to-pap.md`](../revisions/2026-06-07_session-continuity-transition-to-pap.md)
        (evidence, rationale, migration steps, what is — and is not —
        in scope, APDRP-style review of the one real risk this kind of
        change carries: silent loss of historical continuity content).

  **— second milestone, same day: resolving PAP-AUDIT F1/F2 —**
  - [x] Operator supplied original-intent clarifications for both findings
        (quoted verbatim in `AD-040` and in each finding's Resolution
        annotation) — directly, unprompted by any question from this side;
        recorded as received, not paraphrased.
  - [x] Added an in-place Scope note to `.ai/PROJECT_CHARTER.md` (original
        four-item SHALL-NOT list left intact) recording the
        specific-hardware-vs-deployment-strategy line the operator drew.
  - [x] Added an in-place Amendment to `AD-034` in `.ai/decisions.md`
        (original Date/Decision/Rationale left intact) stating the corrected
        operative rule: autonomous action licensed when bounded by
        safeguards and recoverable.
  - [x] Recorded both as one coordinated act, `AD-040`, in `.ai/decisions.md`
        — quoting the operator's clarifications verbatim, cross-referencing
        both in-place amendments and the audit findings they close.
  - [x] Annotated `pap/audits/2026-06-07_broodforge-pap-audit.md` in place:
        a status-update banner near the top; "Resolution" notes on F1 and F2
        (original finding text untouched); an APDRP addendum tying the
        Falsification perspective's named dissolution-condition to what then
        actually happened; strikethrough-preserved "Summary of suggested
        work" entries showing suggested-vs-actual remedy for a future reader.
  - [x] Updated this file and `RESUME_BLOCK.md` to reflect the F1/F2
        resolution milestone.

  **— third milestone, same day: analyzing and integrating the `new/`
  corpus (closing F3) —**
  - [x] Operator issued a direct, scoped instruction to analyze `new/` and
        integrate relevant content into `ROADMAP.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md`,
        explicitly un-deferring F3 — with scoping guidance built directly
        into the instruction (integrate items with "a realistic software
        implementation path... pre-install forge package creation, any
        management tooling, monitoring, orchestration, or documentation
        generation features"; defer "highly speculative, philosophical
        territory — e.g., cross-civilization knowledge transfer, 100-year
        planning scenarios").
  - [x] Read `pap/state/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`/`RESUME_BLOCK.md` (this file's
        own prior state — confirming F3's "deferred" framing) and the
        existing `ROADMAP.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md`/`.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`
        as the source-of-truth baseline before editing either.
  - [x] Surveyed all ~165 documents in `new/` by filename + extracted and
        read full text of the ~22 most plausibly relevant ones (bootstrap/
        first-node architecture, forge package lifecycle, documentation
        engine, runbook generation, reference UI/CLI/API, observability,
        orchestration/control-plane, plus the corpus's own "how to read me"
        entry document `BroodForge_Synthesis_Entry_For_Claude_Analysis_v1.docx`
        and `broodforge.json`) and three "axiomatic kernel" PDFs, to confirm
        the speculative/governance-of-specs framing extended through that
        whole series before deferring it.
  - [x] Identified exactly one concretely-implementable, additive gap: a
        pre-install "Image Builder" — closing the difference between
        broodforge's current only-supported path ("operator already has
        Proxmox VE installed on the target host," per `FORGING.md`'s
        prerequisites) and what Chapter 16/Spec 70/148 name as the unsolved
        case ("a BroodForge environment should be creatable without
        requiring an existing BroodForge deployment... Image Builder
        Architecture may generate ISO images, USB installation media").
        Recorded as proposed **Phase 1.H — Pre-Install Forge Package and
        Image Builder** in `ROADMAP.md`'s new "Proposed Future Work" section,
        and as **AD-057** in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
  - [x] Cross-checked three other corpus areas (Documentation Engine /
        Spec 60, Runbook Generation / Spec 82, Reference UI-Visualization /
        Spec 88, Reference API-CLI / Spec 87) against the existing codebase
        (`doc-gen/`, `dependencies.py`, `capability_state.py`,
        `failure_domain.py`, Phase 9/10 phoenix + operational documentation)
        and recorded them as "already covered, no gap" rather than silently
        dropping them — visible in `ROADMAP.md`'s "What was reviewed and
        found already covered."
  - [x] Recorded, by name, what was deferred and why — federation/economic/
        marketplace/trust specs (138–145), knowledge-civilization/century-
        scale/succession specs (116–132), the RFC-graph self-governance
        series (Coherence Dashboard, Master Control Plane, Orchestration
        Kernel, Coherence Ledger, Bootstrap Order Generator, Post-Bootstrap
        Verification — these govern *the spec corpus as a system*, a
        different problem than the one broodforge solves), and the formal
        axiomatic-kernel/category-theoretic proof PDF series (v1.5–v1.27,
        plus `broodforge.json`'s own `fidelity_translation_only` /
        "forbidden: spec_rewrite, semantic_reinterpretation" framing, which
        reads as "implement me verbatim as a parallel system" rather than
        "mine me for ideas") — in `ROADMAP.md`'s "What was deferred and why."
  - [x] Annotated `pap/audits/2026-06-07_broodforge-pap-audit.md` in place:
        updated the status banner to record F3 as closed, and added an
        in-place "Resolution" annotation on F3 itself (original finding text
        untouched), addressing both halves of the original RISK (loss —
        `new/` is now referenced from governed artifacts; silent scope
        ambiguity — `ROADMAP.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md` now name what in `new/`
        is, and is not, part of broodforge's forward direction).
  - [x] Updated this file and `RESUME_BLOCK.md` to reflect the new state —
        the very update this protocol's `update_trigger` calls for at every
        major milestone (you are reading the result of that update now).

- **last_completed_step**: (Updated — fourth milestone, same session.)
  Following direct operator instruction ("proceed with any autonomous
  roadmap/architecture work that you can that doesn't require my decisions,
  with the occasional session-handoff commit"), extended the draft-sketch
  thread with two more sketches and closed a doc-drift gap the operator
  spotted by inspection:
  - Added **DRAFT SKETCH — Hypervisor Recovery Credentials**: the operator's
    requested "thorough evaluation" of permanently storing Proxmox root
    passwords in KeePass, written up as a recommendation *against* an
    autonomous pathway that can wield full root against live hypervisors
    (named as the one line broodforge should not cross — unbounded blast
    radius, exactly the kind of autonomy the newly-amended AD-034/AD-040
    "bounded by safeguards and recoverability" framing was not meant to
    license), with a concrete middle path: constrained forced-command
    recovery accounts, full root as break-glass behind the *existing*
    human-unlock gate (AD-042, no new pathway), and pre-generated
    human-gated spawn-media credentials (the operator's own proposal,
    adopted as sound).
  - Added **DRAFT SKETCH — Granular Secret Access Silos for Human
    Operators**: the operator's question about tiered, hierarchically-scoped
    human access to secrets (service operator vs. "god-mode" sysadmin,
    scoped to cell/node/VM). Confirmed "god mode" is the right homelab
    default (operator's own framing); sketched a design — derive scoped
    sub-vaults from the canonical KeePass DB along the hierarchy
    `secret-registry.yaml` *already* encodes (`owning_cell`, `required_by:
    [host:X]/[vm:X]`) — that needs no new dependency and changes nothing
    about the trust-model foundations, because KeePass/KDBX has no native
    per-user role layer (named explicitly as the constraint that shapes the
    whole design).
  - Added **`tests/unit/test_meta_doc_sync.py`**, addressing the operator's
    *first* observation this session — "roadmap.html and roadmap.md... is
    not updated... we need to implement some way for changes to the
    broodforge codebase to also trigger its own internal process for
    updating its documentation." Investigation found the drift was worse
    than the operator's example: `ROADMAP.html` (stamped 2026-06-03 vs. the
    `.md`'s 2026-06-07) *and* `docs/ARCHITECTURE.html` (stamped 2026-06-02)
    *and* `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s own header (stamped 2026-05-31, stale relative
    to its own AD-057 entry from `bbc2bdd`) — three different stamps, none
    agreeing. Rather than build a markdown→HTML generator (these `.html`
    files are hand-styled with theme toggles/copy buttons — generating them
    would destroy that), added a drift-detection test mirroring the existing
    `test_html_base_sync.py` pattern: it extracts the version/date stamp
    from each `.md` and its `.html` companion and fails the suite if they
    disagree. Ran it — it failed immediately on the real drift (proving the
    mechanism works), then synced all three stamps and it now passes. This
    *is* the "trigger": broodforge's suite already runs every change cycle,
    so a doc edit that forgets its companion now turns it red immediately —
    the same self-documentation philosophy `doc-gen/drift.py` applies to the
    managed infrastructure, pointed at broodforge's own meta-docs.
  All three sketches are explicitly marked **draft / not phases / not ADs**
  — exactly the "autonomous work that doesn't require operator decisions"
  framing requested: they advance the roadmap's *thinking* without
  committing the operator to anything. `.ai/NEXT_STEPS.md` and
  `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md` updated to index all three plus the new test.
  Before this: wrote the first **DRAFT SKETCH — Recovery-Readiness
  Conformance** (translation table mapping all 13 axiomatic-kernel/
  proof-system PDFs' formal constructs to existing broodforge mechanisms;
  identified the `recovery-readiness-certificate.json` artifact as the one
  genuinely new piece) — in direct response to the operator reconsidering
  part of the F3 deferral and asking to "start drafting what to do with
  these." Before *that*: wrote `ROADMAP.md`'s "Proposed Future Work — from
  `new/` corpus analysis" section (Phase 1.H, "already covered," "what was
  deferred and why"), `ARCHITECTURE.md` AD-057, and the audit's F3
  status-banner update + Resolution annotation (commit `bbc2bdd`); and,
  before that, the F1/F2 resolution milestone (`b0a05ce`) and the continuity
  transition itself (`6f0e9c8`) — see the earlier milestone-checklist blocks.

- **next_action**: **Wait for operator reaction to the three draft
  sketches** now in `ROADMAP.md` "Proposed Future Work" (Recovery-Readiness
  Conformance, Hypervisor Recovery Credentials, Granular Secret Access
  Silos) — all written *as drafts for discussion* per explicit operator
  request, all deliberately stopped short of numbered-phase/AD status. If
  the operator confirms a direction on any of them, write that one up the
  same way Phase 1.H was — scoped roadmap entry plus an AD in
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `.ai/decisions.md` — without pre-emptively promoting
  the others. If the operator redirects or narrows any sketch, revise it in
  place rather than starting a parallel one. **Commit and push** this
  milestone's changes (`ROADMAP.md`, `ROADMAP.html`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.html`, `tests/unit/test_meta_doc_sync.py`,
  `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `.ai/NEXT_STEPS.md`, this file, and
  `RESUME_BLOCK.md`) — the one concrete mechanical step remaining, if it has
  not already happened by the time you are reading this. Beyond the
  draft-sketch thread: **Phase 1.H (Pre-Install Forge Package and Image
  Builder)** also remains **proposed, not started** — a candidate for a
  future session, not a mandate. A resuming agent should either (a) wait
  for/follow new operator direction, or (b) — only if asked to find
  something to do — look to `RESUME_BLOCK.md`'s `next_action` and the
  platform's own named operational next-step ("deploy to hardware," per
  `.ai/NEXT_STEPS.md`).

- **resume_instructions**:
  1. Read `RESUME_BLOCK.md` (this file's `resume_block_ref`) for the
     one-screen save-state.
  2. Read this file's `source_materials` list, in the order given, to avoid
     re-deriving anything in `key_decisions_and_insights`.
  3. Confirm the transition's milestone checklist is still all-`[x]` (i.e.,
     nothing has silently regressed — e.g., a future edit accidentally
     reintroducing a reference to the deprecated `docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`
     path). If anything has changed, that is itself a finding worth
     recording, not silently re-fixing.
  4. Pick up the `next_action` above, or escalate per
     [PAP-Core §6.2](../core/PAP-Core.md#62-escalation-and-disagreement-governance)
     if neither this file nor `RESUME_BLOCK.md` resolves what to do next.

## Provenance

Written as the centerpiece artifact of
[`pap/revisions/2026-06-07_session-continuity-transition-to-pap.md`](../revisions/2026-06-07_session-continuity-transition-to-pap.md),
commissioned by direct operator instruction: *"address the fact that there
were prototype mechanisms for session-handoff, tracking progress, etc. that
left artifacts in the codebase prior to pap's introduction... they need to be
handed off to pap and removed from the broodforge infrastructure, since
revision protocols for the codebase itself of broodforge (not broodforge's
remediation process for failing nodes and general functions it should
perform) should transition to pap."* See that record for the full evidence
trail, the APDRP-style review of the transition itself, and the historical
content this file's predecessor (`docs/deprecated/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`)
preserves in full.
