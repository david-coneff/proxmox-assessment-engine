# Reconstruction Drill Guide

**Document created:** 2026-06-01
**Recommended frequency:** Every 90 days (quarterly)

A reconstruction drill validates that your phoenix playbook accurately describes
the real recovery procedure, measures actual vs. estimated restoration time, and
surfaces gaps that only appear during live execution. The drill record is committed
to Forgejo as auditable evidence of tested recoverability.

---

## Why drill?

The phoenix playbook is generated from bootstrap-state.json — it reflects what the
system *declares* it looks like, not necessarily how it actually behaves during
recovery. Hardware differences, dependency ordering issues, and configuration drift
only reveal themselves when you actually run the procedure.

A drill run against a test environment (cloned VMs, isolated network) catches these
gaps before a real incident forces you to discover them under time pressure.

---

## Pre-drill checklist

```
☐ Obtain a phoenix playbook for the drill target.
    Generate one from bootstrap-state.json with the phoenix planner
    (see docs/PHOENIX.md for the full stargate runbook):
    python3 proxmox-bootstrap/phoenix-planner.py \
      --state proxmox-bootstrap/bootstrap-state.json \
      --output reconstruction/phoenix-playbook-latest.json

☐ Run readiness report and resolve any RED findings:
    python3 doc-gen/engine.py --mode recovery \
      --manifest proxmox-bootstrap/bootstrap-state.json

☐ Ensure PBS backups are current (last successful backup < 24h ago)

☐ Prepare test environment:
    Option A — Isolated physical host (bare Proxmox, no production data)
    Option B — Proxmox VE in a VM (nested virtualization, performance limited)
    Option C — Tabletop walkthrough (paper drill — no live execution)

☐ Notify any affected stakeholders of the drill window
```

## Running the drill

### Step 1 — Start the drill record

Register the drill in bootstrap-state.json before you begin. Set the paths in the
**Parameters** panel at the top once — every command on this page then uses them.

```bash
python3 proxmox-bootstrap/reconstruction-drill.py start \
  --playbook {{PLAYBOOK=reconstruction/phoenix-playbook-latest.json}} \
  --state {{STATE=proxmox-bootstrap/bootstrap-state.json}}
```

This prints a `drill_id` and estimated total time. Record them here so you have a
traceable record of this drill run:

@field[drill_id (printed by the start command)]
@field[Estimated total time (minutes)]
@field[Drill start time (UTC)]

### Step 2 — Execute the playbook (live or tabletop)

Work through the phoenix playbook waves manually, timing each wave and noting any gaps:
- For a **live drill**: execute the actual shell commands in a test environment
- For a **tabletop drill**: walk through each wave's steps on paper, recording issues found

Keep notes on: actual time taken, steps that were unclear, anything that differed from the playbook.

@area[Per-wave actual times, unclear steps, and gaps observed during execution]

### Step 3 — Complete the drill record

When finished, record the outcome and generate a report:

```bash
python3 proxmox-bootstrap/reconstruction-drill.py complete \
  --state {{STATE=proxmox-bootstrap/bootstrap-state.json}} \
  --outcome {{OUTCOME=success}} \
  --gaps "Bridge vmbr1 pre-flight step was unclear" "Wave 3 restore took 2× longer than estimated" \
  --output {{REPORT=drill-report.md}}
```

`--outcome` choices: `success` (default), `partial`, `failed`, `aborted`  
`--gaps` (optional): one or more gap descriptions appended to `gaps_found` in the drill record

@field[Final outcome recorded (success / partial / failed / aborted)]
@field[Actual total time (minutes)]

---

## Viewing drill results

```bash
# Print the most recent drill record as JSON
python3 proxmox-bootstrap/reconstruction-drill.py last \
  --state {{STATE=proxmox-bootstrap/bootstrap-state.json}}

# Regenerate the Markdown report for the last drill
python3 proxmox-bootstrap/reconstruction-drill.py report \
  --state {{STATE=proxmox-bootstrap/bootstrap-state.json}} \
  --output {{REPORT=drill-report.md}}
```

---

## After the drill

```
☐ Review gaps_found in the drill record
☐ For each gap:
    - If it affects the playbook: update phoenix_playbook.py generator and re-generate
    - If it affects bootstrap-state.json: update and commit
    - If it affects metadata YAML: update and commit
☐ Re-run readiness report to verify gaps are resolved
☐ Commit the updated bootstrap-state.json (now includes drill record) to Forgejo
☐ The Assessment Engine will detect the commit and regenerate documentation
```

## Interpreting the drill report

The drill report compares estimated vs. actual time per wave:

| Accuracy | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| 80–120% | Estimates are well-calibrated |
| 120–150% | Estimates are optimistic — update phoenix_playbook.py |
| > 150% | Significant underestimation — review wave complexity |
| < 80% | Estimates are conservative — acceptable |

If outcome is `partial` or `failed`, the recovery readiness score drops to ORANGE
until a successful drill is recorded. This is intentional: a failed drill is important
safety information and should not be hidden.

---

## Scheduling quarterly drills

```bash
# Install a systemd timer for quarterly drill reminders:
sudo bash proxmox-bootstrap/schedule-reconstruction-drill.sh
```

The timer sends a journal log reminder every 90 days. It does not automatically
run the drill — drills require operator involvement by design.

---

## Drill history

All drill records are stored in `bootstrap-state.json` under `reconstruction_drills[]`.
They are never pruned — the full history is preserved as a permanent audit trail.

To view drill history:
```bash
python3 -c "
import json
state = json.load(open('proxmox-bootstrap/bootstrap-state.json'))
for d in state.get('reconstruction_drills', []):
    print(d['drill_id'], d['outcome'], d.get('total_actual_minutes','?'),'min')
"
```
