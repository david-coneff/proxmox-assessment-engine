# Reconstruction Drill Guide

**Document created:** 2026-06-01
**Recommended frequency:** Every 90 days (quarterly)

A reconstruction drill validates that your phoenix playbook accurately describes
the real recovery procedure, measures actual vs. estimated restoration time, and
surfaces gaps that only appear during live execution. The drill record is committed
to Forgejo as auditable evidence of tested recoverability.

---

## Why drill?

The phoenix playbook is generated from bootstrap-state.json — it reflects what the
system *declares* it looks like, not necessarily how it actually behaves during
recovery. Hardware differences, dependency ordering issues, and configuration drift
only reveal themselves when you actually run the procedure.

A drill run against a test environment (cloned VMs, isolated network) catches these
gaps before a real incident forces you to discover them under time pressure.

---

## Pre-drill checklist

```
☐ Generate a fresh phoenix playbook from current state:
    python3 proxmox-bootstrap/phoenix_playbook.py \
      --state proxmox-bootstrap/bootstrap-state.json \
      --output reconstruction/

☐ Run readiness report and resolve any RED findings:
    python3 doc-gen/engine.py --mode recovery \
      --manifest proxmox-bootstrap/bootstrap-state.json

☐ Ensure PBS backups are current (last successful backup < 24h ago)

☐ Prepare test environment:
    Option A — Isolated physical host (bare Proxmox, no production data)
    Option B — Proxmox VE in a VM (nested virtualization, performance limited)
    Option C — Tabletop walkthrough (paper drill — no live execution)

☐ Notify any affected stakeholders of the drill window
```

---

## Running the drill

### Option A — Live execution drill (recommended annually)

Execute the phoenix playbook steps against the test environment, measuring time per wave:

```bash
# Start drill tracking
python3 proxmox-bootstrap/reconstruction-drill.py \
  --state proxmox-bootstrap/bootstrap-state.json \
  --playbook reconstruction/phoenix-playbook-proxmox-cell-a-latest.json \
  --mode live
```

The drill coordinator will:
1. Display each wave's steps
2. Prompt you to confirm completion or record a failure
3. Measure actual time per wave
4. Ask for gaps found during execution
5. Generate a drill report

### Option B — Tabletop walkthrough drill (recommended quarterly)

Walk through the playbook steps without executing them, identifying:
- Steps that are ambiguous or unclear
- Steps that reference resources that may not be available
- Prerequisites that are not met
- Time estimates that seem unrealistic

```bash
python3 proxmox-bootstrap/reconstruction-drill.py \
  --state proxmox-bootstrap/bootstrap-state.json \
  --playbook reconstruction/phoenix-playbook-proxmox-cell-a-latest.json \
  --mode tabletop
```

---

## Recording drill results manually

If you ran the drill without the coordinator script, record results directly:

```bash
python3 proxmox-bootstrap/reconstruction-drill.py \
  --state proxmox-bootstrap/bootstrap-state.json \
  --record-manual \
  --outcome success \
  --actual-minutes 95 \
  --gaps "Bridge vmbr1 pre-flight step was unclear" \
  --remediated "Updated network-topology.yaml with explicit bridge description"
```

---

## After the drill

```
☐ Review gaps_found in the drill record
☐ For each gap:
    - If it affects the playbook: update phoenix_playbook.py generator and re-generate
    - If it affects bootstrap-state.json: update and commit
    - If it affects metadata YAML: update and commit
☐ Re-run readiness report to verify gaps are resolved
☐ Commit the updated bootstrap-state.json (now includes drill record) to Forgejo
☐ The Assessment Engine will detect the commit and regenerate documentation
```

## Interpreting the drill report

The drill report compares estimated vs. actual time per wave:

| Accuracy | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| 80–120% | Estimates are well-calibrated |
| 120–150% | Estimates are optimistic — update phoenix_playbook.py |
| > 150% | Significant underestimation — review wave complexity |
| < 80% | Estimates are conservative — acceptable |

If outcome is `partial` or `failed`, the recovery readiness score drops to ORANGE
until a successful drill is recorded. This is intentional: a failed drill is important
safety information and should not be hidden.

---

## Scheduling quarterly drills

```bash
# Install a systemd timer for quarterly drill reminders:
sudo bash proxmox-bootstrap/schedule-reconstruction-drill.sh
```

The timer sends a journal log reminder every 90 days. It does not automatically
run the drill — drills require operator involvement by design.

---

## Drill history

All drill records are stored in `bootstrap-state.json` under `reconstruction_drills[]`.
They are never pruned — the full history is preserved as a permanent audit trail.

To view drill history:
```bash
python3 -c "
import json
state = json.load(open('proxmox-bootstrap/bootstrap-state.json'))
for d in state.get('reconstruction_drills', []):
    print(d['drill_id'], d['outcome'], d.get('total_actual_minutes','?'),'min')
"
```
