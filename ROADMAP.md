## Roadmap Overview

Phases are organized into three tracks that must be completed in order.

**Track 1 — Cell-Scoped Foundation (Phases 6–12)**
Complete the single-cell documentation and reconstruction capability.
All schemas in this track are updated to carry `cell_id` (federation-readiness gate).

**Track 2 — Expanded State Model (Phases 13–18)**
Add the new state categories required by v5.0: Hardware, Platform, Cluster, Storage,
External Dependencies, Data Protection, Observability, Capability, Federation State.

**Track 3 — Digital Twin and Federation (Phases 19–25)**
Build the Digital Twin platform, federation architecture, federated reconstruction,
and continuous assessment capability.

Track 2 begins after Phase 12 validates single-cell reconstruction.
Track 3 begins after Phase 18 completes the expanded state model.

- [ ] 9.3: Wave 0 (host restore) playbook
- [ ] 9.4: Wave 0.5 (template rebuild) playbook — Ubuntu and Talos variants
      Ubuntu path: cloud-init ISO + Ansible k3s-server role
      Talos path:  talosctl gen config + talosctl apply-config (no Ansible, no cloud-init)
      Variant selected from k3s-cluster.yaml server_nodes[].os_variant
- [ ] 9.5: Per-VM reconstruction playbook
      k3s-server playbook emits correct steps for os_variant (ubuntu or talos)
- [ ] 9.6: Orchestrated `run-all.sh` generator
- [ ] 9.7: Playbook validator (syntax check + dependency check)
- [ ] 9.8: Playbook existence in readiness scorer

**9.T — Talos Alternative Support** *(optional; activate by setting os_variant: talos)*

*Foundation — build and config tooling:*
- [ ] 9.T.1: `docs/TALOS-ALTERNATIVE.md` — prerequisites, build procedure for talos-1x-base
        template, talosctl installation, machine config generation, migration checklist
- [ ] 9.T.2: `proxmox-bootstrap/build-talos-template.sh` — downloads Talos ISO,
        creates Proxmox VM, converts to template (talos-1x-base, VMID 9001)
- [ ] 9.T.3: `proxmox-bootstrap/generate-talos-config.py` — generates talos machine
        configs from k3s-cluster.yaml (control plane + worker patches); stdlib only
- [ ] 9.T.4: Talos template entry in bootstrap-state.json template registry
        (talos-1x-base alongside ubuntu-2204-base; separate base_image entry)
- [ ] 9.T.5: bootstrap-state-schema.json — add `os_variant` enum (ubuntu | talos)
        to template registry entries and provenance_records
- [ ] 9.T.6: doc-gen readiness scorer — YELLOW if os_variant=talos but no Talos
        machine config found in repo (talos-configs/ directory absent)
- [ ] 9.T.7: Recovery runbook — emit Talos-specific reconstruction steps
        (talosctl apply-config instead of Ansible) when os_variant=talos
- [ ] 9.T.8: Tests for Talos config generator and runbook rendering

*OS transition automation — Ubuntu → Talos:*
- [ ] 9.T.9: `proxmox-bootstrap/migrate-k3s-to-talos.py` — automated migration script
        Steps: drain k3s node → snapshot VM → destroy Ubuntu VM → provision Talos VM
        from talos-1x-base template → apply machine config → verify cluster health →
        update bootstrap-state.json os_variant + provenance_records → commit to repo
        Flag: `--dry-run` prints plan without making changes
        Flag: `--skip-snapshot` for test environments where snapshot overhead is unwanted
        Guard: refuses to run if cluster health check fails pre-drain (RED readiness)
- [ ] 9.T.10: Pre-migration checklist validator — confirms all prerequisites before
        migration begins: talos-1x-base template exists, machine config generated,
        Velero PVC backup current (ORANGE if any check fails; migration blocked until GREEN)
- [ ] 9.T.11: Post-migration verifier — confirms k3s node rejoined cluster, all
        namespaces healthy, Flux reconciliation complete, PVCs reattached;
        writes migration completion record to bootstrap-state.json provenance_records
- [ ] 9.T.12: Recovery runbook — "OS Variant Migration" appendix documents the
        Ubuntu→Talos path with pre/post-migration steps and rollback procedure

*OS transition automation — Talos → Ubuntu:*
- [ ] 9.T.13: `proxmox-bootstrap/migrate-k3s-to-ubuntu.py` — automated reverse migration
        Steps: drain k3s node → snapshot VM → destroy Talos VM → provision Ubuntu VM
        from ubuntu-2204-base template → apply Cloud-Init + Ansible k3s-server role →
        verify cluster health → update bootstrap-state.json → commit to repo
        Same flags as 9.T.9 (--dry-run, --skip-snapshot)
        Guard: refuses to run if cluster health check fails pre-drain
- [ ] 9.T.14: Shared migration library `proxmox-bootstrap/migrate_k3s_lib.py`
        Extract common steps from 9.T.9 and 9.T.13: drain, snapshot, VM destroy,
        health check, provenance record update. Both migration scripts import this.
- [ ] 9.T.15: Migration state file `bootstrap-state.json migration_history` array
        Each completed migration appended: from_variant, to_variant, migrated_at,
        migrated_by, snapshot_vmid (for rollback), pre_migration_k3s_version
- [ ] 9.T.16: Rollback procedure — if post-migration verifier fails, restore VM from
        pre-migration snapshot, update os_variant back, re-run health check;
        rollback outcome appended to migration_history
- [ ] 9.T.17: Tests for both migration scripts (mock Proxmox API + mock talosctl/ansible)

## Design Principles

1. **Reconstruction is the objective.** Every state category, metadata field, and
   documentation artifact is evaluated against: "Does this enable reconstruction
   from repository state after complete infrastructure loss?"

2. **Documentation is generated, not authored.** Technical infrastructure information
   is collected automatically. Operators provide only what cannot be discovered.

3. **Cell scope is universal.** `cell_id` is mandatory on every state document.
   No single-environment assumptions anywhere in the data model.

4. **The Digital Twin is the source of truth.** All outputs derive from the twin.

5. **Recovery relationships are explicit.** Which cell holds what for whom is
   declared and verified, not assumed.

6. **Missing information is surfaced, never silently omitted.** UNRESOLVED and
   STALE fields are always visible with reason, impact, and remediation guidance.

7. **Trust is declared and verified.** Inter-cell trust has expiry, is verified at
   Tier 3 assessment, and expired trust degrades federation readiness scores.

8. **Historical snapshots are reproducible.** Same twin state always produces same outputs.

9. **Readiness scoring is honest.** RED means recovery will likely fail.

10. **Single-cell work must be federation-ready from the start.** `cell_id` in all
    schemas. Recovery playbooks organized by cell. Documentation scoped by cell.
    The federation layer is added above, not retrofitted below.
