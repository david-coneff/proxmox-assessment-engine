## Roadmap Overview

Phases are organized into three tracks that must be completed in order.

**Track 1 — Cell-Scoped Foundation (Phases 6–12)**
Complete the single-cell documentation and reconstruction capability.
All schemas in this track are updated to carry `cell_id` (federation-readiness gate).

**Track 2 — Expanded State Model (Phases 13–18)**
Add the new state categories required by v5.0: Hardware, Platform, Cluster, Storage,
External Dependencies, Data Protection, Observability, Capability, Federation State.

**Track 3 — Digital Twin and Federation (Phases 19–25)**
Build the Digital Twin platform, federation architecture, federated reconstruction,
and continuous assessment capability.

Track 2 begins after Phase 12 validates single-cell reconstruction.
Track 3 begins after Phase 18 completes the expanded state model.

## Design Principles

1. **Reconstruction is the objective.** Every state category, metadata field, and
   documentation artifact is evaluated against: "Does this enable reconstruction
   from repository state after complete infrastructure loss?"

2. **Documentation is generated, not authored.** Technical infrastructure information
   is collected automatically. Operators provide only what cannot be discovered.

3. **Cell scope is universal.** `cell_id` is mandatory on every state document.
   No single-environment assumptions anywhere in the data model.

4. **The Digital Twin is the source of truth.** All outputs derive from the twin.

5. **Recovery relationships are explicit.** Which cell holds what for whom is
   declared and verified, not assumed.

6. **Missing information is surfaced, never silently omitted.** UNRESOLVED and
   STALE fields are always visible with reason, impact, and remediation guidance.

7. **Trust is declared and verified.** Inter-cell trust has expiry, is verified at
   Tier 3 assessment, and expired trust degrades federation readiness scores.

8. **Historical snapshots are reproducible.** Same twin state always produces same outputs.

9. **Readiness scoring is honest.** RED means recovery will likely fail.

10. **Single-cell work must be federation-ready from the start.** `cell_id` in all
    schemas. Recovery playbooks organized by cell. Documentation scoped by cell.
    The federation layer is added above, not retrofitted below.
