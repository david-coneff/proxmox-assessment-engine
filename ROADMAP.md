      with per-record detail and manual rollback commands. ODT + HTML. 25 tests.
      Tests: 3757 passed, 37 skipped, 3 pre-existing jsonschema env failures.
- [x] **Full-stack audit findings (round 4)** — all 13 findings resolved:
      S1: setup-secrets.py private key redirected to /dev/tty (not stdout/log);
      S2: RESTIC_PASSWORD env pattern documented as intentional (correct approach);
      S3: headscale auth key no longer partially printed to stdout;
      D1/I4: reconstruction-drill.py CLI wrapper created (start/complete/last/report);
      D2: update_state_after_spawn.py docstring corrected;
      I1: hatchery_receiver.py /api/spawn-complete endpoint; spawn verify script
          POSTs to hatchery on success; hatchery_url embedded in spawn manifest;
      I2: migration scripts commit bootstrap-state.json to git after migration;
      I3: readiness.py _score_migration_health() ORANGE(failed)/YELLOW(rolled_back);
      I5: migrate_k3s_lib.py imports from collector_utils (consistent with round 3 fix);
      A2: 5 state collector import aliases removed (local_runner not _local_runner);
      A3: same as S1. A1 (sys.path coupling) deferred — requires package restructure.
      35 new tests. Tests: 3792 passed, 37 skipped, 3 pre-existing.
- [x] **ODT/ODS renderer deprecation** — all ODT/ODS renderers (recovery_runbook.py,
      runbook.py, operational_report.py, workbook.py) moved to renderers/deprecated/.
      HTML renderers improved during migration: Appendix C (DNS Registry) added to
      html_recovery_runbook.py; service contract blocks now wire correctly in restore
      waves; _health_check_cmds()/_service_restart_cmds() unified; html_operational_report
      gains backup failure actions + inline cert expiry computation. 9 test files migrated.
      Tests: 3745 passed, 37 skipped, 3 pre-existing.
- [x] **Full-stack audit findings (round 5)** — 10 findings, all resolved:
      A1/I2: recovery_workbook.py (missed in ODT sweep) → moved to deprecated/;

      Tests: 3647 passed, 37 skipped, 3 pre-existing.
- [x] **Security fix: /api/spawn-complete path traversal** — hatchery_receiver.py was
      accepting state_path from POST body, allowing any filesystem path to be
      read+written. Fixed: body state_path now ignored; only server-configured --state
      path is used. 1 new test. Tests: 3648 passed.

      Tests: 3720 passed, 37 skipped.
- [x] **Full-stack audit findings (round 9)** — 7 fixes (Round 1 + Round 2):
      Round 1 — A1: html_base.py copied to proxmox-bootstrap/; sys.path.insert removed from 4
          workbook modules; I1: test_hatchery_receiver_wiring.py (16 tests); I3:
          TestScoreMigrationHealth (6 tests) to test_readiness.py; D2: docstring corrected.

      Cycle 2 — I1: bootstrap-state-schema.json security_scan property added; S1: silent
          exception in analyze_all_unanalyzed() now prints warning; D1/D2: RECONSTRUCTION-DRILL.md
          CLI examples replaced (removed fake --mode/--record-manual flags); readiness.py
          docstring corrected (removed false "last scan overdue" claim).
      Cycle 3 — I1: reconstruction-drill.py complete gains --gaps argument; RECONSTRUCTION-DRILL.md
          updated with --gaps example.

## Phases from `new/` corpus analysis *(all proposed phases implemented; deferred items remain out of scope)*

The `new/` directory holds a large proposed-revision corpus (~25 chapters, ~115
specifications/RFCs, plus a separate "axiomatic kernel" formal-methods series).
It was deferred at intake (PAP-AUDIT finding F3 — see
`pap/state/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`) and has now been triaged per direct operator
instruction: items with a realistic implementation path in broodforge or its
documentation tooling are integrated below; the remainder — multi-generational
federation, "knowledge civilization" / cross-civilization exchange, century-scale
succession planning, and the formal axiomatic-kernel/category-theoretic proof
series (`broodforge_*_v1_*.pdf`) — is **explicitly deferred** as out of scope for
broodforge's actual product (a Proxmox/k3s infrastructure platform), not as a
quality judgment on the material itself. See "What was deferred and why" at the
end of this section.

### Phase 1.H — Pre-Install Forge Package and Image Builder *(implemented — commit 072112e; GUI wizard added)*

**Source:** `new/BroodForge_Chapter_16_Bootstrap_and_First_Node_Architecture.docx`,
`new/BroodForge_Specification_70_Bootstrap_Forge_Package_and_First_Node_Deployment.docx`,
`new/BroodForge_Specification_148_Canonical_Bootstrap_and_First_Node_Genesis_Framework.docx`.

**The gap this names:** `FORGING.md` currently lists "Proxmox VE installed on
the target host" as a software prerequisite — forge-manifest.json is generated
entirely on the operator's workstation (Step 1), but the forge package itself
still has to be copied onto an *already-installed* Proxmox host (Step 2+). The
corpus's Chapter 16 names the gap directly: *"The first BroodForge node exists
before infrastructure memory, assessment systems, and regeneration systems are
operational... A BroodForge environment should be creatable without requiring
an existing BroodForge deployment,"* and calls out "Image Builder Architecture"
— generating "ISO images, USB installation media, appliance images... derived
from infrastructure knowledge" — and "Bootstrap Bundle Deployment" as the
concrete mechanism.

**Proposed scope (additive — does not replace the existing path):**

- [x] `generate-bootstrap-image.py` — Image Builder CLI. Consumes
      `forge-manifest.json` plus a Proxmox VE unattended-installer answer file
      (`answer.toml`, Proxmox 8+ automated installer format) and produces a
      single bootable ISO/USB image bundling: (a) the automated Proxmox VE
      installer, (b) the assembled forge package, (c) a first-boot hook.
- [x] Answer-file template generator — `generate-answer-file.py` CLI and
      `generate_answer_toml()` in `_image_builder.py`. Derives `answer.toml`
      (disk layout, network, root credentials, timezone) from the same
      `forge-manifest.json` fields the guided-setup framework (AD-049) already
      collects, so the operator answers setup questions exactly once.
      `generate-answer-file.py` generates answer.toml standalone (for review or
      re-generation without building a full image bundle);
      `generate-bootstrap-image.py` calls the same library function as part of
      the full staging bundle build.
- [x] First-boot automation hook — a systemd unit installed by the answer
      file's post-install script that runs the embedded forge package's
      `forge.sh` automatically on the freshly-installed host's first boot,
      replacing the manual "SSH in and kick off forging" step.
- [x] Image artifact verification — hash/signature manifest for the generated
      image, following the same supply-chain verification pattern already
      established for forge/spawn/phoenix packages (AD-042 KeePass gating,
      AD-051 HTML manifest alongside every machine-readable manifest).
- [x] `FORGING.md` gains an alternative "Step 0 — Build pre-install media
      (optional)" path; the existing "Proxmox already installed" path remains
      the supported baseline for operators who provision hosts another way
      (existing Proxmox cluster, hosting-provider-imaged hardware, etc.).
- [x] `forge-image-builder.html` — cross-platform GUI wizard for the Image
      Builder CLI: self-contained HTML, offline-first, dark/light theme toggle,
      live command preview, clipboard copy. No server required.

**Why this is additive, not a redesign:** the forge manifest is *already*
generated entirely on the operator's workstation before any contact with the
target host (FORGING.md Step 1). This phase only extends what that planning
step can *output* — from "a package you copy onto an already-installed host"
to "a bootable image that installs the host and then runs the package" —
closing exactly the gap the corpus names as "creating the first node without
requiring an existing deployment," using artifacts broodforge already builds.

**Explicitly out of scope (do not expand into):** generic multi-hypervisor
image builders, or "appliance images" for arbitrary target platforms. Chapter
16 itself frames these as "future implementations" and Specification 70 is
explicit that *"the initial implementation shall target the validated
reference stack rather than attempting universal platform support"* — i.e.
the corpus's own text agrees this stays Proxmox-VE-and-reference-hardware
scoped, consistent with broodforge's existing AD-040.

See AD-057 in `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the architecture-level decision record.

### What was reviewed and found already covered

- **Documentation Engine / Infrastructure Memory publication**
  (`new/BroodForge_Specification_60...docx`) and **Runbook Generation /
  Operational Workbook** (`new/BroodForge_Specification_82...docx`) describe,
  at a conceptual level, almost exactly what `doc-gen/` + the Phoenix
  playbook system (Phase 9) + Operational Documentation (Phase 10) already
  do: generate runbooks, workbooks, and recovery documentation from
  infrastructure state rather than hand-authoring them. No gap found.
- **Reference UI and Knowledge Visualization**
  (`new/BroodForge_Specification_88...docx`) names "capability maps,"
  "dependency maps," "trust maps," and "regeneration maps" as desirable
  dashboard features. `doc-gen/dependencies.py`, `capability_state.py`,
  `failure_domain.py`, and the HTML recovery runbook/workbook renderers
  already implement dependency-graph and capability-relationship
  visualization in the generated documentation and dashboard. No gap found
  worth a dedicated phase; incremental visualization improvements should
  continue to ride along with the renderer work that already owns this area.
- **Reference API/CLI** (`new/BroodForge_Specification_87...docx`) — "the
  CLI is authoritative; APIs are built on the same capability model" matches
  broodforge's existing pattern (every planner/assembler is CLI-first;
  `hatchery_receiver.py` exposes the only HTTP API surface, deliberately
  thin). No gap found.

### What was deferred and why

The remainder of the `new/` corpus describes a substantially different,
larger architecture vision than broodforge's actual product line — most of
it framed around governing *the specification corpus itself* (a "Global
Coherence Ledger," "Coherence Certification Authority," "RFC Index,"
"Master Control Plane," "Unified System Orchestration Kernel," "Bootstrap
Order Generator" for reconstructing *the RFC graph*, federated "knowledge
civilization" exchange, century-scale "knowledge commons" and succession
planning, and a separate fully-formal "axiomatic kernel" series
(`broodforge_*_v1_*.pdf` — category-theoretic abstraction, terminal
synthesis theorems, metatheoretic irreducibility, etc.) — rather than
managing Proxmox/k3s infrastructure, which is what broodforge actually does.
`new/broodforge.json` itself frames this material as a `fidelity_translation_only`
handoff that forbids "architecture_simplification… spec_rewrite… semantic_
reinterpretation" — i.e. it is asking to be implemented verbatim as a
parallel system, not mined for ideas. Per the operator's explicit
instruction (and consistent with PAP-AUDIT finding F3's original framing —
"highly speculative, philosophical territory"), none of this is integrated:
- Federation/economic/marketplace/trust-scoring specifications (138–145)
- Knowledge-preservation/civilization/century-scale specifications (116–132)
- The RFC-graph self-governance series (Coherence Dashboard, Master Control
  Plane, Orchestration Kernel, Coherence Ledger, Bootstrap Order Generator,

  a system*, which is a different problem than the one broodforge solves

### Phase 1.I — Recovery-Readiness Conformance *(implemented — commit 3b32137)*

**Status: implemented — commit 3b32137.** Proposed from the
draft sketch below by direct operator decision: *"Recovery-Readiness
Conformance → Scope as Phase 1.I... Build as additive extensions to existing
`readiness.py`, `drift.py`, `dependencies.py`, snapshot/provenance store, and
Phase 12 drills. Write an AD for it."* See **AD-059** in `ARCHITECTURE.md`
for the architecture-level decision record.

**Proposed scope (additive — extensions to existing modules, no new
subsystem):**

- [x] `recovery-readiness-certificate.json` (+ HTML, AD-051 pattern) —
      generator that composes, into one timestamped record: the manifest hash
      (canonical serialization + SHA-256 over `bootstrap-state.json` + the 10
      metadata YAMLs), the graph hash (SHA-256 over each of the five
      `dependencies.py` dependency graphs' canonical form), the current
      readiness score (RRS/ACS/DCS/CRS/OSS from `readiness.py`), the latest
      drift summary (`drift.py`), and the latest `DrillRecord` (Phase 12).
- [x] Hash recording wired into snapshot generation — each
      `history/snapshots/` entry gains `manifest_hash`/`graph_hash` fields, so
      "the graph that produced this readiness score" is independently
      checkable after the fact, not just at generation time.
- [x] `replay-snapshot.py` — re-derives a manifest's readiness score and
      drift report from a stored snapshot and asserts it matches what was
      recorded at the time, turning "snapshots are reproducible" (an existing
      design constraint — `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md` "Key Design Constraints")
      from an assumption into a checked, reportable fact.
- [x] Documentation pass — write down, in plain language, what broodforge
      does *not* promise to recover automatically (the "Human Intervention
      Boundary," e.g., "if the KeePass database itself is lost, no amount of
      manifest replay restores secrets").

#### Human Intervention Boundary — what's autonomous vs. operator-required

The recovery-readiness conformance pipeline mixes autonomous, read-only
composition with steps that genuinely require a human. Naming the line
between them precisely is the documentation deliverable above; the line is:

**Autonomous (no operator action required):**
- *Certificate generation* (`generate-recovery-readiness-certificate.py`) —
  pure read-only composition of evidence already on disk: hashes the manifest
  and dependency graph, reads the current `ReadinessReport`, the latest drift
  summary, and the latest recorded `DrillRecord`. Produces no side effects
  beyond writing the certificate JSON/HTML.
- *Hash recording* (`history/index.py::build_index`) — regenerates
  `manifest_hash`/`graph_hash` for every snapshot already captured in
  `history/snapshots/`; reads raw snapshot manifests, writes only the
  derived index.
- *Replay / conformance check* (`replay-snapshot.py`) — re-derives a stored
  snapshot's hashes and readiness signal and asserts they match what was
  recorded; a verification pass over existing data — nothing is mutated.
- *Readiness scoring and drift detection* (`readiness.py`/`drift.py`,
  already existing) — both already run unattended as part of `doc-gen`'s
  bootstrap/recovery/operational report generation.

**Requires an operator (broodforge will not do this for you, by design):**
- *Running a reconstruction drill* — `reconstruction_drill.py`'s `DrillRecord`
  only exists because a human deliberately executed a drill (followed the
  generated phoenix playbook, timed the waves, recorded gaps). The certificate
  *reports* the latest drill's outcome; it cannot conjure a drill that wasn't
  run, and a certificate generated for a cell with no drill history says so
  plainly rather than implying readiness it hasn't demonstrated.
- *KeePass master-password entry* — every credential broodforge manages is a
  KeePass reference, not a plaintext value (AD-021/AD-040). If the KeePass
  database itself is lost or its master password forgotten, no amount of
  manifest replay, certificate verification, or graph-hash matching restores
  the secrets it held — this is the canonical "Human Intervention Boundary"
  example named in the operator's original framing of this phase.
- *restic/rclone restore execution* — broodforge documents and plans backups;
  an operator (or their break-glass procedure) actually runs the restore.
  The readiness score can say a backup is present and recent; it cannot
  perform the restore itself.
- *Acting on certificate findings* — if a certificate reports RED/BLOCKED
  components, single points of failure, or HIGH-severity drift, a human
  decides what to do about it (broodforge's remediation queue can *propose*
  actions per Phase 26, but operator approval gates anything destructive or
  credential-touching).

This boundary is not a gap to be closed — it is the deliberate trust-model
line AD-040 draws (git + KeePass + restic as the actual trust anchors, no
autonomous full-root pathways). The certificate's job is to make today's
*position relative to that boundary* visible and checkable, not to erase it.

**Explicitly out of scope (do not expand into):** the cryptographic apparatus
named in the formal-proof-series corpus — Ed25519 root-of-trust chains,
category-theoretic compositional proof objects, formal certification
"levels" with externally-audited conformance. That apparatus is heavier than
broodforge's actual threat model (a home-lab / small-cell operator using
git + KeePass + restic as the trust anchors, per AD-040's SHALL-NOT scope);
building it would be exactly the "implement the spec corpus verbatim" outcome
the `new/` corpus deferral correctly avoided. This phase is additive scoring
fields, one new generated artifact, and a documentation pass — not a rewrite.

The analysis that produced this scope — including the full formal-concept →
broodforge-mechanism translation table — follows below for reference.

**Source of this analysis:** operator follow-up, 2026-06-07. After the `new/`
corpus deferral was recorded, the operator reconsidered one slice of it and
asked for a draft of "what to do with these":

> "the formal-proof series does in theory require software implementation of
> how broodforge documents itself to accommodate the proof process... It's
> about making sure that systems can prove their readiness to recover and/or
> that the state observed matches the intent manifest on record."

That is a narrower and more concrete claim than "implement the axiomatic
kernel" — it says the ~13-document formal-proof/axiomatic-kernel series
(`broodforge_formal_state_transition_proofs_v1_8`,
`broodforge_compositional_proof_system_v1_11`,
`broodforge_completeness_boundary_conditions_v1_7`,
`broodforge_operational_validation_benchmarking_v1_23`,
`broodforge_deployment_certification_conformance_v1_24`,
`broodforge_root_manifest_crypto_spec_v0_4`,
`broodforge_system_graph_schema_v0_5`,
`broodforge_reconciliation_engine_spec_v0_6`,
`broodforge_reconciliation_semantics_v0_2`,
`broodforge_observability_audit_replay_v1_1`,
`broodforge_security_proof_invariant_guarantees_v1_5`,
`broodforge_failure_threat_model_hardening_v1_0`,
`broodforge_action_runtime_idempotent_layer_v0_7`) names two real, narrow
concerns underneath its category-theoretic dress:

1. **Provable recovery readiness** — not just "we scored GREEN," but a
   reproducible demonstration that reconstruction would succeed.
2. **Observed-state ↔ intent-manifest conformance** — a defensible answer to
   "does what's actually running match what we declared it should be?", with
   evidence, not just a diff.

broodforge already has *informal* versions of every formal construct in that
series. None of this needs a from-scratch "axiomatic kernel" — it needs the
existing mechanisms drawn into one place and given a verifiable, replayable
output. Translation table (formal concept → broodforge today → possible
extension):

| Formal concept (PDF series) | broodforge today | Possible additive extension |
|---|---|---|
| Root Manifest (hashed, Ed25519-signed, chained) | `bootstrap-state.json` + 10 metadata YAMLs (plain JSON/YAML, git-tracked, KeePass-gated) | Add a canonical-serialization + SHA-256 content hash for the manifest set, recorded alongside each snapshot in `history/` — tamper-evidence without changing the trust model (git + KeePass + restic remain the actual trust anchors) |
| System Graph (content-addressed nodes/edges, `graph_hash`) | Five dependency graphs in `doc-gen/dependencies.py` | Hash each graph's canonical form at generation time; store the hash next to the graph in the snapshot index so "the graph that produced this readiness score" is independently checkable |
| Reconciliation engine `R(actual, spec) → next`, fixed-point convergence | `remediation_planner.py` / `remediation_queue.py` / `remediation_executor.py` (Phase 26) | Record, per remediation cycle, the pre-/post-state deviation vector and whether it shrank monotonically — turns "did remediation help?" into a measured, logged claim instead of an assumption |
| Drift classification + deviation vector δ, threshold δ_threshold | `doc-gen/drift.py` field-level diff | Bucket existing drift findings into structural/behavioral/performance/security classes and attach a magnitude, so drift reports gain a comparable severity axis (this is a reclassification of existing output, not a new detector) |
| Benchmark scores (GFS/RCS/ADS/PCS) | RRS/ACS/DCS/CRS/OSS scores already in `readiness.py` / assessment engine | No new scores needed — the formal series is naming the same idea (composite, comparable health metrics) with different letters |
| Deployment Certificate (manifest hash + graph hash + conformance level) | Readiness scoring (GREEN…BLOCKED) + drift report + Phase 12 `DrillRecord`, generated separately | **The one genuinely new artifact worth drafting further**: a single generated `recovery-readiness-certificate.json` (+ HTML) that bundles the manifest hash, graph hash, current readiness score, latest drift summary, and latest drill result into one timestamped, signed-by-reference object — "as of this run, here is the evidence that this cell could recover, and here is what it was declared to be" |
| Hash-chained event log + deterministic replay (Strict/Evaluated/Debug modes) | `history/snapshots/` + provenance registry + audit logging already present | Add a `replay-snapshot.py` that re-derives a manifest's readiness score and drift report from a stored snapshot and asserts it matches what was recorded at the time — turns "snapshots are reproducible" (an existing design constraint, see `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md` "Key Design Constraints") from an assumption into a checked, reportable fact |
| Idempotent action runtime, global invariants I1–I5 | Remediation actions are already required to be idempotent (Phase 26 design); `ALLOWED_ACTION_TYPES`/`_HANDLERS` assertion in `continuous_assessment.py` | Document the existing idempotency guarantees and the handler-set invariant explicitly as "invariants broodforge already enforces," rather than inventing new ones — most of I1–I5 already hold informally |
| Trusted/Controlled/Untrusted boundary, "Human Intervention Boundary," explicit non-guarantees | Implicit in KeePass-gated secrets, restic/rclone backup trust model, and the reconstruction-drill model (a human runs the drill) | Write down, in plain language, what broodforge does *not* promise to recover automatically (e.g., "if the KeePass database itself is lost, no amount of manifest replay restores secrets — that is the documented Human Intervention Boundary") — this is a documentation task, not a code task |

**What this draft is *not* proposing:** the cryptographic apparatus
(Ed25519 root-of-trust chains, category-theoretic compositional proof
objects, formal certification "levels" with externally-audited conformance)
is heavier than broodforge's actual threat model (a home-lab / small-cell
operator using git + KeePass + restic as the trust anchors, per AD-040's
SHALL-NOT scope). Building a parallel formal-verification subsystem would be
exactly the kind of "implement the spec corpus verbatim" outcome the
deferral above correctly avoided. The translation table above is deliberately
phrased as *extensions to existing modules* (`readiness.py`, `drift.py`,
`dependencies.py`, the snapshot/provenance store, Phase 12 drills) — additive
scoring fields, one new generated artifact, and a documentation pass — not a
rewrite.

**This scope was confirmed by direct operator decision on 2026-06-08** — see
the status block at the top of this section and AD-059.

### Phase 1.J — Hypervisor Recovery: Constrained Accounts and Pre-Generated Spawn Media *(implemented — commit f883540)*

**Status: implemented — commit f883540.** Promoted from the
draft recommendation below by direct operator decision, which also recorded a
**firm architectural constraint** ruling out any autonomous pathway that can
read and wield full root credentials against live hypervisors — see **AD-060**
in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, which records that constraint and its two narrow,
explicitly-bounded exceptions (temporary credentials for node spawning and for
phoenix recovery sessions, both already-established patterns extended, never
the permanent keystore). The three-part middle path below is **accepted as
stated** and forms this phase's implementation targets.

**Proposed scope (additive — no autonomous full-root pathway, per AD-060):**

- [x] **Constrained recovery account per hypervisor** — a dedicated,
      narrowly-scoped account provisioned during forge phase-03 (host config),
      gated by a forced command (`ForceCommand`/`command=` in
      `authorized_keys`) limited to a fixed menu of read-only diagnostics and
      safe operations (status, logs, VM start/stop) — never an arbitrary
      shell. Because its blast radius is bounded *by construction*, this is
      the one piece of the recovery surface safe to query autonomously.
- [x] **Break-glass root — storage annotation, not a new mechanism.**
      `secret-registry.yaml` already tracks `pve0X-root-password` entries per
      `host:X`; this item documents/annotates those entries as
      human-unlock-gated break-glass root, behind the *same* gate that already
      protects every other secret (AD-042), with **no new autonomous
      pathway** — functionally "the recovery runbook tells the operator where
      to find it and they type it themselves."
- [x] **Pre-generated spawn-media credentials.** Run the existing AD-043
      passphrase-generation pattern earlier — at image-build time (Phase 1.H)
      — and embed the result on install media instead of generating it at
      install time. Requires human authorization before a node installed from
      such pre-made media is allowed to join the cell — the operator's own
      proposed safeguard, which slots into the same place the existing
      autonomous-mode service-selection confirmation already lives (AD-041).
- [x] **Phoenix package temporary-credential extension.** Per the operator's
      explicit direction, extend the node-spawning temporary-credential
      pattern (Cloud-Init: a generated pre-install root passphrase, used only
      for discovery, discarded the instant the KeePass-managed replacement is
      installed — already in place) to phoenix recovery packages: a temporary
      root credential scoped to the phoenix setup session only, with a hard
      requirement — recorded directly in the generated phoenix runbook — that
      the operator rotates the credential once the recovery session completes.
      Scoped as part of the Phase 9 phoenix-package design.

The analysis that produced this scope follows below for reference.

**Source of this analysis:** operator follow-up, 2026-06-07. The operator
asked for a thorough evaluation of whether broodforge should start
*permanently* storing each Proxmox host's root password in KeePass —
reasoning that the hatchery already handles a *temporary* root passphrase
during spawn discovery (`ARCHITECTURE.md` lines ~159–169: generated
pre-install, used for SSH-based hardware discovery, discarded the moment
Cloud-Init installs a KeePass-managed credential), and a permanent version
would (a) close the gap where a node that boots to Proxmox but fails to bring
up its VM/k3s layer is currently a dead end requiring physical console access,
and (b) give broodforge "a genuinely complete keystore of all node root
passwords," including the ability to autonomously pre-generate credentials for
future spawns and embed them in install media (gated by human authorization
before the resulting node is allowed to join — the operator's own proposed
safeguard).

**The benefit is real; so is the risk, and the risk dominates.** Today, even a
total compromise of the hatchery or KeePass yields, at worst, operational
credentials for nodes mid-spawn — a narrow, time-boxed set, because the
temporary passphrase dies the instant Cloud-Init replaces it. A permanent
"complete keystore of all node root passwords" converts that same compromise
into root on *every hypervisor in the cell — the substrate everything else
runs on*. That is not a difference of degree; it is the difference between
"compromise the secrets layer" and "own the entire infrastructure,
permanently, with no expiry to bound the damage." The sharpest form of the
danger is the one the operator named directly: an *autonomous* execution-
broker pathway that can read and wield a permanent root password turns any
bug, misconfiguration, or compromise of *that one pathway* into root on every
hypervisor at once — a far larger escalation surface than anything that exists
in broodforge today, and exactly the kind of unbounded autonomous action the
newly-amended AD-034/AD-040 ("autonomous action is acceptable when bounded by
safeguards and recoverability," per the F2 resolution recorded earlier today)
was never meant to license, because root has no boundary by definition.

**Recommended middle path — gets the recovery benefit without the liability:**

1. **Constrained recovery accounts, not root, for the "diagnose a
   partially-failed node" case.** Provision a dedicated, narrowly-scoped
   account per hypervisor with a forced command (`ForceCommand` /
   `command=` in `authorized_keys`) limited to a fixed menu of read-only
   diagnostics and safe operations (status, logs, VM start/stop) — never an
   arbitrary shell. Even total compromise of that credential store yields
   only the fixed command surface, never root. Because its blast radius is
   bounded *by construction*, this is the one piece that could safely be
   queried autonomously.
2. **Full root as break-glass, governed by the gate that already exists.**
   Where genuine root is unavoidable (e.g., filesystem repair), store it —
   but behind the *same human-unlock gate* that already protects every other
   secret in the system (AD-042), with **no new autonomous pathway**. This is
   functionally "the recovery runbook tells the operator where to find it and
   they type it themselves" — a storage change, not a privilege change. It
   delivers the "complete keystore, nothing orphaned" property on a trust
   boundary that is already trusted, at zero new attack-surface cost.
3. **Pre-generated spawn-media credentials — adopt as described.** This part
   of the proposal is sound as stated and cheap to build: it is the existing
   `AD-043` passphrase-generation pattern, just run earlier and shipped on
   media instead of typed by an operator at install time. The operator's own
   proposed safeguard — human authorization required before a node installed
   from such pre-made media is allowed to join — costs nothing architecturally;
   it slots into the same place the existing autonomous-mode service-selection
   confirmation already lives (AD-041).

**The line this sketch recommended broodforge not cross — and which the
operator has now confirmed as a firm architectural constraint (AD-060):** an
autonomous pathway that can read and wield full root credentials against live
hypervisors. Everything else the operator described — the complete keystore,
pre-generated spawn media, human-gated joining — is reachable through the
human-unlock gate (for break-glass root) and a constrained-command account
(for routine diagnostics) without ever building that pathway. **This direction
was confirmed by direct operator decision on 2026-06-08** — see the status
block at the top of this section, AD-060, and Phase 1.J's scope, which scopes
items 1 and 3 above as implementation targets and item 2 as the
`secret-registry.yaml` / `SecretRegistry` annotation described.

**Enforcement points (AD-060):**
- `lib/forge-lib.sh`, `forge_keepass_gate()` (line 46): operator-presence gate
  that must be called in every process/subprocess chain before any `kdbx_get`
  invocation; persists the session to a 0600 tmpfs file so later sub-phases
  resume without re-prompting while still requiring the initial human unlock
- `lib/forge-lib.sh`, `kdbx_get()` (line 94): the only function that reads a
  secret from KeePass; defined exclusively in operator-initiated package scripts
  (forge, spawn, phoenix phases) — not present in any autonomous or scheduled path
- `proxmox-bootstrap/forge_scripts.py`, generated phase-05 and phase-06 scripts:
  `forge_keepass_gate` called before any `kdbx_get` invocation; k3s join tokens
  and service passwords only — no hypervisor root credentials are read via
  `kdbx_get` in any generated script
- `proxmox-bootstrap/assemble_spawn_package.py` and `proxmox-bootstrap/phoenix_scripts.py`:
  `forge_keepass_gate` embedded in generated package scripts; credentials accessed
  are scoped to the spawn/phoenix session (temporary, per AD-060 exceptions)
- `tests/unit/test_forge_assembler.py`, `test_phase_05_calls_keepass_gate_before_kdbx_get`
  and `test_phase_06_calls_keepass_gate_before_kdbx_get`: assert gate precedes
  any `kdbx_get` call in generated phase scripts (text-position enforcement)
- No `kdbx_get`, `keepassxc-cli`, or KeePass credential access appears in
  `proxmox-bootstrap/continuous_assessment.py`, `proxmox-bootstrap/run-continuous-assessment.sh`,
  or `proxmox-bootstrap/setup-continuous-assessment-schedule.sh` — the
  autonomous/scheduled paths are structurally isolated from credential reads

### Phase 1.K — Granular Secret Access Silos: Vault Hierarchy and User Provisioning *(implemented — commit c750ed6)*

**Status: implemented — commit c750ed6.** Promoted from the
draft sketch below by direct operator decision, which expanded its scope in
two ways: (1) higher-tier vaults must include records of the access
credentials for lower-tier scopes, so a god-mode operator can always recover
a scoped vault's passphrase from their own vault; and (2) the design must
include a mechanism for creating users at the VM level and the Proxmox level,
with default templates corresponding to the proposed scope divisions, each
provisioned with access to its scoped vault. See **AD-061** in
`ARCHITECTURE.md` for the architecture-level decision record (vault hierarchy
+ user provisioning design).

**Proposed scope (additive — no new dependency, no change to the trust-model
foundations; "god mode" remains the homelab default):**

- [x] **`Role`/`Scope` registry** — a new authoritative YAML (following the
      existing 10-metadata-file pattern in `data-model/`): each entry names a
      role, a hierarchical scope expressed as glob patterns over the
      *existing* `owning_cell`/`required_by` vocabulary in
      `secret-registry.yaml` (`cell-1/*`, `cell-1/node-1/*`,
      `cell-1/node-1/vm-3/*`, or by `secret_type`/`required_for` facet), and
      which humans currently hold that role.
- [x] **`derive-scoped-vault` generator** — reads the canonical KeePass DB
      plus the Role/Scope registry and produces a derivative `.kdbx`
      containing only the entries matching the declared scope, with its own
      freshly-generated passphrase (reusing `generate_master_password_suggestion()`
      / EFF passphrase generators, AD-043/AD-052). The canonical "god mode"
      database remains exactly what it is today.
- [x] **Vault-of-vaults recordkeeping (operator-directed expansion).** Each
      derived vault's generated passphrase is itself written as an entry in
      the *next tier up* (ultimately the canonical god-mode vault), so a
      higher-tier operator can always recover any lower-tier scoped vault's
      passphrase from their own vault — generalizing the per-backup
      unique-secret bookkeeping pattern already established in AD-044.
- [x] **User-provisioning templates at the VM and Proxmox levels
      (operator-directed expansion).** Default account templates corresponding
      to each declared scope tier (e.g., service operator / node sysadmin /
      god mode), created at forge/spawn time, each provisioned with access to
      exactly its corresponding scoped vault and nothing beyond it.
- [x] **Authorization model** — only holders of the canonical vault can mint
      scoped vaults or scope-tier user templates; true by construction ("you
      can only derive a scope you can already see the contents of"), matching
      who is trusted to run `forge-planner.py`/`spawn-planner.py` today.
- [x] **Revocation = rotate + reissue**, documented up front as an honest
      non-guarantee (a property of the offline-first model — a derived vault
      cannot leak ciphertext it never received, arguably a *stronger*
      guarantee than a layered ACL).

The analysis that produced this scope follows below for reference.

**Source of this analysis:** operator follow-up, 2026-06-07. The operator
asked whether broodforge could support tiered, hierarchically-scoped secret
access for *human* operators — e.g., a service operator who can manage their
service but cannot reach the Proxmox root password, versus a sysadmin with
"god-mode" access to everything, or to everything within a declared scope (a
cell, a node, a VM). For the operator's own homelab, single-operator "god
mode" is and remains the right default — this is explicitly framed as a "for
a larger org" consideration, not an immediate need.

**The constraint that shapes the design: KeePass/KDBX databases are
single-master-password — there is no native per-user role layer inside one
`.kdbx` file.** Building real per-user ACLs would require either (a) an
external identity-aware secrets broker (Vault-style) — which contradicts
broodforge's offline-first, stdlib-only, "runs without network access"
design constraints (`.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md` "Key Design Constraints"; AD-042's
entire premise is that the KeePass file can be embedded in offline packages
with no server dependency), or (b) **multiple derived vaults**, each scoped to
a declared subset of secrets, each with its own independently-generated
master password, distributed only to the humans who need that scope. (b) is
the one that fits broodforge's existing architecture with no new dependency
and no change to its trust-model foundations — it is "more vaults derived
from the one vault," not "one vault with roles bolted on."

**broodforge already has the data model this needs — it just isn't used for
this yet.** `proxmox-bootstrap/secret-registry.yaml` (`SecretRegistry`)
already records, per secret: a stable `id`, a `keepass_path`, an `owning_cell`,
and a `required_by` list using exactly the hierarchical vocabulary the
operator described — `host:pve01`, `vm:infra-bootstrap`, etc. — plus
`secret_type` and `rotation_schedule`. That is, in effect, an undeclared scope
hierarchy (cell → host/node → vm → service) sitting in the registry today.
Sketch of what an additive extension could look like:

- **A `Role`/`Scope` registry** (a new authoritative YAML, following the
  existing 10-metadata-file pattern in `data-model/`): each entry names a
  role, a hierarchical scope expressed as glob patterns over the *existing*
  `owning_cell`/`required_by` vocabulary (`cell-1/*`, `cell-1/node-1/*`,
  `cell-1/node-1/vm-3/*`, or by `secret_type`/`required_for` facet — e.g.,
  "all `service-credential` entries, no `password`-type host-root entries"),
  and which humans currently hold that role.
- **A `derive-scoped-vault` generator**: reads the canonical KeePass DB plus
  the Role/Scope registry, and produces a derivative `.kdbx` containing
  *only* the entries whose `secret-registry.yaml` record matches the
  declared scope — with its own freshly-generated passphrase (reusing the
  existing `generate_master_password_suggestion()` / EFF passphrase
  generators, AD-043/AD-052). The canonical "god mode" database remains
  exactly what it is today — broodforge's default, and the homelab's
  permanent answer.
- **Authorization model: only holders of the canonical vault can mint scoped
  vaults.** This needs no new permission system — "you can only derive a
  scope you can already see the contents of" is true by construction, and
  matches who is trusted to run `forge-planner.py`/`spawn-planner.py` today.
- **Revocation = rotate + reissue**, not real-time access removal — this is
  an honest *non-guarantee* worth documenting up front (an explicit
  "boundary," in the vocabulary the formal-proof-series sketch above
  borrowed): a lost or outdated scoped vault is neutralized by rotating the
  secrets it contained (generalizing the existing per-backup unique-secret
  rotation in AD-044) and reissuing a fresh derivative, not by some
  in-database access-list edit. Static derived vaults cannot support instant
  kick-out; that is a property of the offline-first model, not a flaw in this
  design specifically — and arguably a *feature* from a security-properties
  standpoint: a derived vault literally cannot leak what ciphertext it never
  received, which is a stronger guarantee than an ACL layered on top of a
  database the holder already possesses in full.

**What this draft is *not* proposing:** real-time per-user audit logs of
"who opened which secret when" (would require a broker/network dependency
broodforge deliberately avoids — though correlating "scoped vault X was used"
is possible for free, since each derived vault is a distinguishable
credential), or cryptographic enforcement of scope beyond "the derived vault
simply does not contain out-of-scope ciphertext" (which, as noted above, is
arguably the more robust property anyway). Both are named here as explicit
boundaries, not gaps to be closed later.

**This direction was confirmed by direct operator decision on 2026-06-08** —
"useful enough to keep on the roadmap for when this stops being a
single-operator homelab" turned out to be exactly the operator's call, with
the two expansions (vault-of-vaults recordkeeping, user-provisioning
templates) folded in. See the status block at the top of this section,
AD-061, and Phase 1.K's scope above.

### Phase 1.L — Static Analysis Self-Audit Integration *(implemented — commit f7446be)*

**Status: implemented (commit f7446be).** Phase 1.L complete.
See **AD-062** in `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the architecture-level decision record.

**The gap this names:** Broodforge has extensive runtime assessment (readiness scoring,
drift detection, remediation pipeline) but no systematic assessment of the *code itself*
— shell scripts, Python modules, and generated script samples are never automatically
checked for correctness, security issues, dead code, or test coverage gaps. This phase
adds a three-tier static analysis pipeline that feeds into the existing remediation
system rather than creating a separate track.

**Three-tier architecture:**

| Tier | Artifact | Tools | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `tools/run-static-audit.sh` | shellcheck, ruff, bandit, vulture, detect-secrets, pytest-cov | Manual / CI |
| 2 | pytest integration | shellcheck via `tests/static/test_shellcheck.py`, ruff + bandit via pyproject.toml | Every `pytest` run |
| 3 | Dashboard Code Health card | `assess_code_health()` in `continuous_assessment.py`, card in `broodforge_dashboard.py` | Continuous assessment cycle |

**Proposed scope:**

- [x] `tools/run-static-audit.sh` — standalone audit script (Tier 1):
      shellcheck on all `.sh` files + generated script samples; ruff, bandit, vulture,
      detect-secrets; pytest with coverage; produces `.audit/static-audit-report.md`;
      exits non-zero on any HIGH finding.
- [x] `.audit/` directory with `.gitkeep`; `*.json` and `*-report.md` added to `.gitignore`;
      `.secrets.baseline` committed (detect-secrets baseline).
- [x] pytest integration (Tier 2):
      `pyproject.toml` updated with ruff, bandit, detect-secrets, vulture dev deps and
      `--cov` default options; `tests/static/test_shellcheck.py` — finds all `.sh` files
      and runs shellcheck on each (generated scripts tested with minimal test manifests).
- [x] `assess_code_health()` in `continuous_assessment.py` (Tier 3):
      returns `CodeHealthScore` dataclass (shellcheck_findings, bandit_high_count,
      bandit_medium_count, vulture_dead_code_pct, coverage_pct, overall 0-100).
- [x] `code_health_to_remediation_candidates()` in `continuous_assessment.py`:
      authoritative conversion from `CodeHealthScore` → remediation candidate dicts;
      HIGH bandit findings → HIGH candidate, ≥5 shellcheck warnings → MEDIUM candidate.
      `broodforge_dashboard.py`'s `_code_health_to_remediation_candidates()` delegates
      here rather than duplicating the logic.
- [x] "Code Health" card in `broodforge_dashboard.py` alongside existing readiness/drift/
      dependency cards; HIGH bandit/shellcheck findings surface in remediation pipeline.
- [x] Tests: `assess_code_health()` unit tests (subprocess mocked), shellcheck test file,
      dashboard Code Health card rendering test.

**Constraint:** static analysis findings feed into the existing remediation pipeline
(not a separate system). The `RemediationCandidate` pattern from Phase 26 is reused.

**Out of scope:** cloud-based SAST services, paid tools, SonarQube, Snyk, Veracode,
GitHub Advanced Security, or any tool requiring a commercial license.

See AD-062 in `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the architecture-level decision record.

### Phase 1.M — Dynamic Analysis Self-Audit Integration *(implemented — 2026-06-09)*

**Status: implemented (2026-06-09).** Extends Phase 1.L with a dynamic analysis tier.
See **AD-063** in `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the architecture-level decision record.

**What this adds:** Runtime and behavioral verification tools that discover failures
static analysis cannot — property-based tests (hypothesis), mutation testing (mutmut),
bash script testing (bats), and coverage-guided fuzzing (atheris fuzz targets).

**Scope implemented:**

- [x] `DynamicHealthScore` dataclass in `continuous_assessment.py`:
      `hypothesis_failures`, `mutation_score_pct`, `bats_total/passed/failed`,
      `overall` (0–100, -1 = NOT_IMPLEMENTED), `not_implemented` flag.
- [x] `assess_dynamic_health()` in `continuous_assessment.py`:
      detects @given decorators (hypothesis), runs mutmut results parser,
      runs bats TAP output parser; returns `not_implemented=True` when no
      dynamic infrastructure exists yet.
- [x] `_build_dynamic_health_subcard()` in `broodforge_dashboard.py`:
      renders hypothesis failures, mutation score, bats pass/total in the
      Code Health dashboard card; handles `not_implemented` state gracefully.
- [x] `dynamic_health_to_remediation_candidates()` in `continuous_assessment.py`:
      authoritative conversion from `DynamicHealthScore` → candidate dicts;
      hypothesis failures → HIGH, low mutation score → HIGH/MEDIUM, bats failures → HIGH.
      `broodforge_dashboard.py`'s `_code_health_to_remediation_candidates()` merges
      static + dynamic by delegating to both shared functions. `collect_health_
      remediation_candidates()` convenience function in `continuous_assessment.py`
      runs both assessments and returns the merged list in one call.
- [x] `run_continuous_assessment()` in `continuous_assessment.py` (R7-003):
      first-class production caller for `collect_health_remediation_candidates()`.
      Converts findings to `RemediationProposal`s, deduplicates by `{issue_id}:{action_type}`
      against active (non-terminal) queue entries, and submits new proposals via
      `add_proposal()`. Returns `{candidates_found, submitted, duplicates_skipped,
      assessed_at}`. CLI entry point (`__main__`) accepts `--manifest` / `--repo-root`
      for operator and cron invocation.
- [x] `proxmox-bootstrap/run-continuous-assessment.sh` — shell wrapper for direct / cron
      invocation of the assessment loop (cron example in file header).
- [x] `proxmox-bootstrap/setup-continuous-assessment-schedule.sh` — installs
      `broodforge-continuous-assessment.service` + `.timer` (every 6 hours, follows the
      same pattern as `setup-operational-schedule.sh`).
- [x] deal pre/postcondition contracts on `build_spawn_plan()`,
      `build_derived_vault_plan()`, and `score_component()`.
- [x] beartype plugin wired in `conftest.py` (zero new test code needed).
- [x] `pyproject.toml` dev deps: hypothesis, mutmut, beartype, deal, schemathesis,
      atheris (Linux-only note); `[tool.mutmut]` config section.
- [x] Hypothesis property tests in `tests/unit/test_spawn_planner.py`,
      `tests/unit/test_vault_hierarchy.py`, `tests/unit/test_readiness.py`.
- [x] `tests/bash/forge_phase_test.bats` — phase script exit code tests with
      mocked pvesh/kubectl/ssh commands via PATH manipulation.
- [x] `tests/fuzz/fuzz_manifest.py` and `tests/fuzz/fuzz_spawn_planner.py` —
      atheris fuzz targets (no-op on non-Linux; importable everywhere).
- [x] Tests: 51 new tests across dynamic health scoring, dashboard rendering,
      remediation candidates, hypothesis property tests.

**PAP-AUDIT §6 alignment:** all seven integration steps implemented:
beartype (conftest.py), deal contracts, hypothesis property tests, mutmut config,
bats scripts, schemathesis config (openapi.yaml path), atheris fuzz targets.

See AD-063 in `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full decision record.

### Phase 1.N — Migration Infrastructure *(implemented — 2026-06-09, revised 2026-06-09)*

**Status: implemented (2026-06-09); schema version format revised and phoenix
gate added (2026-06-09).** Provides the schema versioning and safe state
migration pathway for broodforge. See **AD-065** in `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the
architecture-level decision record.

**The gap this names:** As broodforge evolves its `bootstrap-state.json` schema,
operators need a safe, operator-gated way to apply schema migrations without
risking data loss or running assessments against partially-migrated state.

**Scope implemented:**

- [x] `proxmox-bootstrap/version.py` — Single source of truth for the package's
      current schema version. Contains one constant:
      `SCHEMA_VERSION: str = "2026-06-09_00-00-00_0000000"`. This file is **not
      edited by hand** — update it by running `bash scripts/forge-stamp-version.sh`.
- [x] `lib/forge-lib.sh` — Shared operator utility library: `forge_keepass_gate`,
      `forge_keepass_find_db`, `kdbx_get`. Extracted from the forge package's
      embedded script pattern so that standalone migration scripts can source it
      directly from the repo.
- [x] `scripts/forge-quiesce.sh` — Stops `broodforge-continuous-assessment.timer`
      and `broodforge-operational-schedule.timer` (via `systemctl stop`), waits up
      to 30 seconds for any running `.service` instances to complete, and creates
      `/var/lib/broodforge/migration.lock` with a JSON payload recording
      `locked_at`, `pid`, and `reason`. Calls `forge_keepass_gate` (AD-065) before
      any action to enforce operator presence. Exits 1 on failure.
- [x] `scripts/forge-resume.sh` — Validates that `migration.lock` exists (exits 1
      if not — prevents accidental out-of-context use), removes it, restarts both
      timers, and runs a brief health check (`continuous_assessment.py`). Prints
      "broodforge resumed" on clean exit or "broodforge resumed with health
      warnings — check dashboard" if the health check exits non-zero.
- [x] `scripts/forge-migrate.sh` — High-level orchestrator the operator runs.
      Ceremony order: (0) pre-flight package hash verify (warn, non-fatal);
      (1) `forge-quiesce.sh`; (2) phoenix recovery package via
      `forge-phoenix-pack.sh` with operator export prompt; (3) timestamped backup
      of all `.json` state files and `manifest.toml` in
      `/var/lib/broodforge/backups/pre-migration-<timestamp>/`; (4)
      `migration_manager.py`; (5) `forge-resume.sh` on success or backup restore
      + resume on failure. Supports `--state-dir`, `--migrations-dir`, `--dry-run`,
      and `--skip-phoenix`.
- [x] `scripts/forge-phoenix-pack.sh` — Stub wrapper that calls
      `assemble_phoenix_package.py` to generate a full disaster-recovery export
      before migration. Currently exits 2 (`FORGE_INCOMPLETE`) until the phoenix
      assembler gains a standalone "pack current state" CLI. `forge-migrate.sh`
      handles exit 2 gracefully and continues without a package.
- [x] `scripts/forge-stamp-version.sh` — Version-stamping ceremony. Accepts an
      optional `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_<7-char-hash>` argument; if omitted, derives
      one from the current UTC time and `git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD`. Updates
      `version.py` and calls `package_verifier.py --stamp` to recompute the
      descriptor. Run this after **any** package change.
- [x] `scripts/forge-verify-package.sh` — Thin wrapper around
      `package_verifier.py --verify`. Prints a human-readable PASS / FAIL / WARN
      line. Used as a pre-flight step in `forge-migrate.sh`.
- [x] `proxmox-bootstrap/package_verifier.py` — Deterministic SHA-256 content
      hash verifier. Hashes all `.py` files under `proxmox-bootstrap/`, `engine/`,
      and `migrations/`; all `.sh` files under `scripts/` and `lib/`; and
      `manifest.toml` if present. File list sorted lexicographically for
      reproducibility. Writes `package-descriptor.json` (`--stamp`) or compares
      against it (`--verify`). **`package-descriptor.json` is explicitly excluded
      from the hash** to avoid a circular dependency (the descriptor records the
      hash of everything else).
- [x] `proxmox-bootstrap/migration_manager.py` — Schema versioning and migration
      runner. Reads `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` from `version.py`. Reads
      `schema_version` from `bootstrap-state.json` (defaults to `"initial"` if
      absent). Discovers `migrate_<from>__to__<to>.py` scripts (double-underscore
      separator) in `migrations/` or `--migrations-dir`, runs them in timestamp
      order via `importlib`, and appends each result to
      `/var/lib/broodforge/migration-history.jsonl`. Supports `--state-dir`,
      `--migrations-dir`, and `--dry-run`.
- [x] `proxmox-bootstrap/bootstrap_state.py` — Bootstrap-state.json loader with
      `schema_version` handling. `load_bootstrap_state()` reads the file, validates
      `schema_version` (format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_<hash>` or sentinel
      `"initial"`), and emits a `warnings.warn(UserWarning)` + `logger.warning`
      if the file is from a newer schema version than `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`
      (loaded from `version.py`). Returns a `BootstrapState` dataclass.
- [x] `migrations/` directory — `README.md` (naming convention, `run(state_dir)`
      contract, versioning ceremony, phoenix gate docs) and
      `migrations/migrate_initial__to__2026-06-09_00-00-00_0000000.py` (first
      real migration: stamps `schema_version: "2026-06-09_00-00-00_0000000"` into
      `bootstrap-state.json`; idempotent).
- [x] Tests: `tests/unit/test_migration_manager.py` — full test suite covering
      `SchemaVersion` parsing and ordering (new timestamp+hash format, `"initial"`
      sentinel), `discover_migrations()` (double-underscore filenames),
      `load_migration()`, `read_schema_version()`, `run_migrations()` (nothing-to-do,
      single migration, multi-migration, failure/halt, dry-run),
      `append_migration_log()`, the `migrate_initial__to__2026-06-09_00-00-00_0000000`
      migration script, and `bootstrap_state.py` (schema_version warning, missing
      file, allow_missing).

**Schema version format:** `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_<7-char-hash>` (e.g.
`"2026-06-09_14-30-22_a3b4c5d"`).  The special sentinel `"initial"` represents
state that pre-dates the versioning system and sorts before all real versions.
Migration filenames use `__to__` (double underscore) as the from/to separator
to disambiguate the boundary since version strings contain underscores.

**Versioning ceremony:** after any package change, run
`bash scripts/forge-stamp-version.sh` to update `version.py` and recompute
`package-descriptor.json`.  Run `bash scripts/forge-verify-package.sh` at any
time to sanity-check the descriptor.

**AD-065: Migration requires operator presence (KeePass gate in forge-quiesce.sh).
No autonomous pathway may initiate migration.**

See AD-065 in `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full decision record.

**Enforcement points (AD-065):**
- `scripts/forge-quiesce.sh`, line 47: `forge_keepass_gate` call — operator
  presence required before any timer stop, service drain, or lock-file creation;
  this is the human-authorization boundary for the migration path
- `proxmox-bootstrap/migration_manager.py`, `main()` function: lock-file check —
  refuses to run (exit 1) if `<state_dir>/migration.lock` does not exist; the
  check fires before migration discovery and before any state file is read or
  written; `--dry-run` does not bypass this check; error output cites AD-065 and
  names `forge-quiesce.sh` so operators know what to run
- `scripts/forge-migrate.sh`, step 1 (line 95): calls `forge-quiesce.sh`
  unconditionally as the first action; the only documented operator entry point
  for applying schema migrations
- `proxmox-bootstrap/continuous_assessment.py` and
  `proxmox-bootstrap/run-continuous-assessment.sh`: contain no call to
  `migration_manager.py`, `forge-migrate.sh`, or `forge-quiesce.sh` — the
  autonomous assessment loop cannot escalate to migration
- `proxmox-bootstrap/setup-continuous-assessment-schedule.sh`: installs a
  systemd service that runs only `continuous_assessment.py`; the unit has no
  path to any migration script
- `tests/unit/test_ad065_migration_lock.py`: confirms that direct invocation of
  `migration_manager.main()` exits non-zero when `migration.lock` is absent;
  covers plain invocation, `--dry-run`, error message content, and the ordering
  guarantee that the lock check fires before any migration script executes

### Phase 1.O — Coordinated Quiesce + Backup (CQB) *(implemented — 2026-06-09)*

**Status: implemented (2026-06-09).** Provides the operator-triggered and
scheduled backup/restore ceremony for broodforge. Designed for the reality of
k8s cattle VMs: etcd snapshot + restic PVC backup is the primary k8s workload
backup (not vzdump). Full VM disk backup is an explicit opt-in for
pre-migration use. See ARCHITECTURE.md for the governing decision records.

**The gap this names:** broodforge accumulates significant state in
`bootstrap-state.json`, etcd, and PVC volumes. Before any risky operation a
snapshot of this state must be taken, coordinated with service quiescence.
There was no unified ceremony for this.

**Architecture decisions (Phase 1.O):**
- k8s workload backup = etcd snapshot (`etcdctl snapshot save`) + restic PVC
  backup. Talos/Ubuntu k8s VMs are cattle OS (Cloud-Init). Full VM disk
  snapshots (vzdump) are NOT the default.
- Governance VM: phoenix pack covers `BROODFORGE_STATE_DIR`. No vzdump by
  default.
- `full_vm_disk_snapshot=True` is an explicit operator opt-in (e.g. `--scope
  full` for pre-migration). Default scopes do not trigger vzdump.
- Dashboard backup forms are restricted to level ≤ 1 scopes; level-2+ scopes
  require `forge-backup.sh` (KeePass gate enforced in the shell layer).

**Scope implemented:**

- [x] `proxmox-bootstrap/backup_manager.py` — Complete CQB implementation:
  - `BackupScope` dataclass: `include_broodforge`, `quiesce_level` (0–3),
    `vm_ids`, `include_proxmox_host_config`, `k8s_etcd_snapshot`,
    `k8s_pvc_backup`, `full_vm_disk_snapshot`. `include_broodforge` is
    non-optional (forced True with `UserWarning`). `quiesce_level >= 2`
    auto-enables `include_proxmox_host_config`.
  - `BackupManifest` dataclass: all scope fields + `k8s_snapshots`,
    `vm_snapshots`, `broodforge`, `proxmox_host_config`. JSON
    serialize/deserialize via `to_dict()` / `from_dict()`. `save()` / `load()`
    write and read `<backup_dir>/manifest.json`.
  - `BackupScopeInferrer.infer()`: maps blast-radius strings to `BackupScope`:
    `"broodforge-config"` → level 0 (no k8s/VM); `"pod:*"` / `"service:*"`
    → level 1 (k8s etcd+PVC, no vzdump); `"vm:*"` / `"node:*"` → level 2
    (host config + k8s); `"full"` / `"unknown"` / unrecognised → level 3
    (everything, vzdump enabled).
  - `BackupManager.backup()`: orchestrates phoenix pack → host config restic →
    k8s etcd snapshot → k8s PVC restic → vzdump (if `full_vm_disk_snapshot`).
    Clock injected via `now_fn` parameter (no bare `datetime.now()`).
  - `BackupManager.restore()`: prints restore procedure for etcd, vzdump, and
    phoenix package. Does not auto-overwrite live state.
  - `BackupManager.list_backups()`: returns manifests newest-first.
  - `BackupManager._pack_broodforge()`: calls `assemble_phoenix_package.py`.
  - `BackupManager._snapshot_proxmox_host_config()`: restic backup `/etc/pve`.
  - `BackupManager._snapshot_k8s()`: `etcdctl snapshot save` + restic PVC.
  - `BackupManager._snapshot_vms_full()`: vzdump (explicit opt-in only).
  - All subprocess calls have `timeout=_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT` (300 s).
  - Exit codes: 0=success, 1=fatal, 2=NOT_IMPLEMENTED (FORGE_INCOMPLETE).
  - CLI: `--backup`, `--restore <id>`, `--list`, `--infer-scope --affects <str>`,
    `--dry-run`, `--json`, `--scope`, `--trigger`, `--state-dir`.

- [x] `scripts/forge-backup.sh` — Operator backup entry point. Sources
  `lib/forge-lib.sh`. KeePass gate enforced for `--scope full`, `vm:*`,
  `node:*` (level ≥ 2). Calls `backup_manager.py --backup`. Exit 2 (partial
  backup) treated as warning, not fatal.

- [x] `scripts/forge-restore.sh` — Always KeePass-gated. Operator must type
  `restore` to confirm before proceeding. Calls `backup_manager.py --restore`.
  Validates manifest exists before prompting.

- [x] `scripts/forge-list-backups.sh` — No gate (read-only). Calls
  `backup_manager.py --list [--json]`.

- [x] `scripts/forge-backup-scheduled.sh` — Cron/systemd-timer safe. Reads
  `${BROODFORGE_STATE_DIR}/backup-schedule.json` (time window, scope,
  max_age_hours). Exits 0 silently if outside window or recent backup exists.
  Refuses level-≥2 scopes (no unattended VM-level operations). Falls back to
  sensible defaults if `backup-schedule.json` is absent.

- [x] `proxmox-bootstrap/broodforge_dashboard.py` — CQB Backup & Restore panel
  added (between Backup Status and Security Posture sections):
  - Backup list table: backup_id, scope, trigger, quiesce_level, k8s status
    (etcd/pvc badges), timestamp, per-row Restore… button.
  - Trigger backup form: scope dropdown (level 0/1 only — level-2+ require
    CLI), dry-run checkbox, Run Backup button.
  - Restore form: backup ID input, dry-run default, Restore button (prints
    procedure; does not overwrite state).
  - Scheduled backup note: points to `backup-schedule.json`.
  - New API endpoints: `GET /api/cqb-backups`, `POST /api/cqb-backup`,
    `POST /api/cqb-restore`. All POST endpoints require `X-Broodforge-Token`.
    Level-≥2 scopes rejected from the dashboard (CLI required).
  - Nav bar: 💾 CQB Backups JSON link.

- [x] `tests/unit/test_backup_manager.py` — 14 tests covering:
  `test_infer_scope_broodforge_only`, `test_infer_scope_pod`,
  `test_infer_scope_service`, `test_infer_scope_vm`, `test_infer_scope_node`,
  `test_infer_scope_unknown_defaults_to_full`,
  `test_infer_scope_unrecognised_defaults_to_full`,
  `test_infer_scope_full_string`,
  `test_backup_manifest_roundtrip`, `test_manifest_roundtrip_json_file`,
  `test_backup_creates_manifest_file`, `test_backup_dry_run_writes_no_files`,
  `test_list_backups_sorted_newest_first`, `test_list_backups_empty`,
  `test_restore_aborts_if_manifest_missing`,
  `test_restore_dry_run_aborts_if_manifest_missing`,
  `test_backup_id_uses_now_fn`, `test_backup_id_format`,
  `test_include_broodforge_forced_true`,
  `test_quiesce_level_2_auto_enables_host_config`,
  `test_scope_roundtrip`.

**Deployment notes:**
- etcdctl path requires `etcdctl` in PATH. Set `ETCDCTL_ENDPOINTS`,
  `ETCDCTL_CACERT`, `ETCDCTL_CERT`, `ETCDCTL_KEY` for TLS.
- restic requires `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` + `RESTIC_PASSWORD` env vars.
- PVC candidate paths: `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/storage`, `/var/openebs/local`,
  `/mnt/pvc`, `/data/pvc` — adjust in `_snapshot_k8s()` per deployment.
- Scheduled backup: create `${BROODFORGE_STATE_DIR}/backup-schedule.json`
  and add `forge-backup-scheduled.sh` to cron or a systemd timer.

**Note: Credential hierarchy (KeeShare child DBs, key rotation ceremony) →
Phase 1.P.** The backup system uses the KeePass gate but does not manage
the credential lifecycle or rotation ceremony. That is explicitly deferred
to Phase 1.P.

---

## Phase 1.P — Credential Hierarchy and Key Rotation *(implemented — 2026-06-09)*

**Status: implemented (2026-06-09).** Introduces a hierarchy of child KeePass
databases scoped to service domains, a secrets broker that serves credentials
by reference path, and a key rotation ceremony with strict propagation ordering.
See the design decisions below for the security model.

### Child DB domains

| Database | Scope |
|---|---|
| `forge-autonomous.kdbx` | Autonomous operation credentials: restic repo password, k8s service account tokens, monitoring API keys, Headscale API key |
| `forge-spawn.kdbx` | Spawn-phase credentials: Cloud-Init keypairs, spawn-phase node credentials, Headscale pre-auth keys |
| `forge-migrate.kdbx` | Migration-phase credentials: temporary elevated access (populated only during migration ceremony) |

Child DB passwords are stored as entries in the master KeePass under
`Broodforge/child-dbs/<name>`. Child DB paths are declared in
`$BROODFORGE_STATE_DIR/credential-hierarchy.json`.

### KeeShare sync

One-way authoritative (master always wins). GUI setup required once per child DB
(KeePassXC → Database Settings → KeeShare; CLI does not support KeeShare
configuration). After initial GUI setup, `forge-sync-credentials.sh` propagates
per-entry credential changes — called automatically by `forge-rotate-credential.sh`
as step 5 of the rotation ceremony, no operator GUI action needed for subsequent
rotations. Full group mirroring of new entries still requires a GUI sync.

### Secrets broker

Consumer processes reference credentials by path — they never see the child DB
password or the master DB password:

```bash
secret=$(kdbx_get_child "child://forge-autonomous/restic/repo-password")
code=$(kdbx_totp "child://forge-autonomous/admin-ui/totp")
```

`kdbx_get_child` and `kdbx_totp` are defined in `lib/forge-lib.sh`. The child DB
password is fetched from master once per session and held in `_CHILD_DB_PASSWORD_CACHE`
(in-memory associative array — never written to disk, env vars, args, or logs).
`forge_keepass_gate` must be called before any broker function.

### Key rotation ceremony (strict order — never deviate)

```
1. Generate new credential
2. Register NEW with service while OLD still active (dual-validity window)
3. Verify NEW credential authenticates against service     ← EXIT 1 if fails
4. Update master KeePass entry                            ← operator confirms
5. forge-sync-credentials.sh                              ← runs automatically
6. Child DBs updated → consumers get NEW on next broker call
7. Remove OLD credential from service
```

Step 3 must succeed before step 4. Step 4 must complete before step 5.
Enforced by `forge-rotate-credential.sh` script structure — not just policy.

### Security properties

- Child process cannot observe out-of-scope master contents
- Child DB password never passed on CLI, written to env, logged, or persisted outside
  the `_CHILD_DB_PASSWORD_CACHE` associative array (session memory only)
- Sync is automatic within the rotation ceremony; standalone `forge-sync-credentials.sh`
  available for ad-hoc re-sync
- Rotation propagation enforced by ceremony structure — no step can be silently skipped

### keepassxc-cli KeeShare capability gap

`keepassxc-cli` (KeePassXC ≤ 2.7) does not support KeeShare merge operations.
`forge-sync-credentials.sh` detects this at runtime and falls back to per-entry
propagation via `keepassxc-cli edit` / `keepassxc-cli add`. This covers the key
rotation case. Full group mirroring (for new entries not yet in a child DB) still
requires a GUI sync — the scripts print a reminder when this is the case.

If a future KeePassXC version adds `keepassxc-cli share-export` / `keepassxc-cli merge`,
`forge-sync-credentials.sh` will detect and use it automatically (the script checks
`keepassxc-cli --help` for `share`/`merge` keywords before falling back).

## Phase 1.U — Kubernetes User Registry *(implemented — 2026-06-10)*

**Status: implemented (2026-06-10).** Introduces a user registry above the
Kubernetes layer so that every broodforge service user is tracked centrally.
On a full cluster rebuild or service state loss, `forge-provision-users.sh`
re-registers all active users automatically — no manual re-registration, no
waiting for users to sign up again.

### Design motivation

Without central tracking, a cluster rebuild means: service loses all data →
admin posts a "please re-register" notice → users trickle back in over days
→ some never return. With the user registry: admin runs `forge-provision-users.sh`
→ every enrolled user's account is recreated in every service they use, with
their stored credentials, before the cluster is considered ready.

### User disposition model

Each user has a `disposition` field that drives rebuild behaviour:

| Disposition | Rebuild behaviour |
|---|---|
| `active` | Created/reset in every enrolled service by default |
| `archived` | Skipped during provisioning; record retained for audit |
| `pending-deletion` | Skipped during provisioning; awaiting manual account deletion |

Operators manage dispositions via the sidecar GUI or CLI:

```bash
python3 proxmox-bootstrap/user_registry.py --disposition alice archived
```

### Per-service enrollment and roles

Each user specifies which services they use and their role per service
(e.g. `user`, `admin`, `developer`). New services can be added to a user's
enrollment at any time; the next `forge-provision-users.sh` run picks them up.

### Credential storage convention

All per-user credentials live in the master KeePass under a predictable path:

```
Broodforge/users/<username>/<service>/password
Broodforge/users/<username>/<service>/totp-secret
```

`forge-onboard-user.sh` generates strong random credentials (48-char password,
20-byte TOTP secret) and writes them to KeePass at onboarding time. The
onboarding package (printed or written to a file) contains the password and
TOTP URI for every enrolled service so the user can configure their authenticator
app in one step.

### Zero-knowledge and key throw-away

Services store password hashes (bcrypt/argon2) — not plaintext. Vaultwarden
additionally encrypts all vault contents client-side; even with server access
an admin cannot read a user's vault.

After the user confirms receipt of their onboarding package, the admin may
optionally discard their master copy:

```bash
python3 proxmox-bootstrap/user_registry.py \
    --throw-away-key alice vaultwarden
```

This sets `key_thrown_away: true` in the registry. On future rebuilds:

- `key_thrown_away = false` → **auto-provision**: stored password re-applied
- `key_thrown_away = true`  → **reset flow**: service account created with
  a temporary password; user is notified to set their own on first login

### Sidecar GUI surface

The user registry is the data source for the "Users" panel in the broodforge
sidecar dashboard. The panel provides:

- Active user list with per-service enrollment and disposition badges
- "Onboard new user" form (calls `forge-onboard-user.sh`)
- Per-user disposition controls (active / archive / mark-for-deletion)
- "Key throw-away" action (requires onboarding acknowledged)
- "Provision all" / "Provision user" rebuild triggers
- Rebuild status: shows which users were auto-provisioned vs reset-flow

### Provisioning flow (rebuild)

```
1. forge-provision-users.sh reads config/user-registry.json
2. For each active user × enrolled service:
   a. key_thrown_away=false → call service adapter → create/reset account
      with stored KeePass password
   b. key_thrown_away=true  → call service adapter → create account with
      temp password + notify user to reset on first login
3. Print rebuild report: N auto-provisioned, M reset-flow
```

Service adapters (Vaultwarden, Headscale, Gitea) call `kubectl exec` against
the relevant pod. New adapters are added as `_provision_<service>()` functions.

| `scripts/forge-provision-users.sh` | Re-provision all active users into k8s services; auto-provision or reset flow per key_thrown_away state; service adapters for Vaultwarden, Headscale, Gitea |

### KeePass path convention

```
Broodforge/users/<username>/<service>/password      ← auto-provision source
Broodforge/users/<username>/<service>/totp-secret   ← TOTP base32 + URI in Notes
```

Interacts with Phase 1.P: user credentials live in the master KeePass DB
(same gate as the credential hierarchy) and are subject to the same
`forge_keepass_gate` access control. Key rotation for service users can be
incorporated into the Phase 1.P rotation ceremony.

---

## Phase 1.Q — Zero-Touch Node Provisioning

**Status: Implemented**

Enables bare-metal Proxmox nodes (broodlings) to join the cluster with zero
keyboard/monitor/KVM interaction after the initial ISO burn. The hatchery
(governance VM) governs the entire join lifecycle. The operator approves
joins from the sidecar dashboard.

### Node lifecycle

```
planned → iso-built → joining → pending-approval → active
                                                  ↘ blacklisted (any pre-active state)
active → decommissioned
```

### Design decisions

- **Headscale** is the single mechanism for both LAN and WAN node joining.
  A single-use pre-auth key is embedded in the ISO; the Headscale server URL
  is the only required network reachability.
- **Codenames** (adjective-animal, e.g. `swift-falcon`) are operator-friendly
  identifiers that persist through the node's lifecycle.
- **Join PIN** (`###-###-###-###`) is generated at plan time using
  `secrets.randbelow`, embedded in the ISO, and sent by the broodling with
  its registration request. The dashboard surfaces both the codename and PIN
  in the pending-approval queue so the operator can cross-verify the specific
  ISO used — without exposing the node's private key. The 12-digit triplet
  format (1 trillion combinations) is designed to be readable at a glance.
- **Join deadline** (optional): the sysadmin can set a cutoff after which an
  un-joined node is auto-blacklisted on its next registration attempt. Default
  is `null` (permissive — no deadline). Sysadmins can always un-blacklist.
- **Operator approval required**: no node reaches `active` without explicit
  operator confirmation from the dashboard. Automatic join is intentionally
  not supported.
- **Atomic state writes**: all state mutations write to `.tmp` then `rename()`
  and are protected by an `fcntl.flock` exclusive lock.

### Delivered files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `proxmox-bootstrap/node_planner.py` | Core lifecycle module — planning, registration, approval, decommission; CLI |
| `scripts/forge-plan-nodes.sh` | KeePass-gated interactive batch node planner |
| `scripts/forge-build-node-iso.sh` | Generates `answer.toml`, `broodling-bootstrap.sh`, and operator README for ISO build |
| `tests/unit/test_node_planner.py` | 16 unit tests covering all lifecycle paths + PIN + deadline |
| `proxmox-bootstrap/broodforge_dashboard.py` | Nodes panel added: pending-approval queue (with PIN), lifecycle table, active node detail panel, decommission, rename-headscale, reassign-address, join deadline; new endpoints: `POST /api/node-register`, `GET /api/provisioning-nodes`, `GET /api/provisioning-nodes/<codename>`, `POST .../approve`, `POST .../blacklist`, `POST .../unblacklist`, `POST .../decommission`, `POST .../rename-headscale`, `POST .../reassign-address`, `POST .../set-deadline`, `PATCH .../<codename>` |

### Operator workflow

1. `./scripts/forge-plan-nodes.sh --count N --role worker` — plans N nodes,
   persists to `provisioning-state.json`, prints codenames + PINs.
2. `./scripts/forge-build-node-iso.sh --codename <name>` — generates
   `answer.toml` and `broodling-bootstrap.sh` in a staging directory.
3. Operator copies artifacts to a Proxmox host and runs
   `proxmox-auto-install-assistant prepare-iso` (must run on the PVE host,
   not the hatchery VM) to assemble the bootable ISO.
4. Burn ISO to USB, power on server — Proxmox installs automatically.
5. On first boot the node generates its RSA key pair, POSTs to
   `POST /api/node-register` (encrypted with hatchery public key), and joins
   the Headscale network.
6. Approve the join from the sidecar dashboard Nodes panel — verify codename
   **and** PIN match the ISO manifest before approving.

### PAP compliance

- No bare `datetime.now()` — all clock access via injected `now_fn` parameter.
- All `subprocess.run()` calls use `timeout=60`.
- Exit codes: 0=success, 1=fatal, 2=NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
- Atomic state writes via `.tmp` → `rename()` with `fcntl.flock`.

## Phase 2.A — Identity & SSO (Authentik)

### Summary
Self-hosted identity provider and SSO for all cluster services. No cloud dependency.
Local accounts remain the primary auth method. SSO is a convenience path, not a replacement.

### Technology
**Authentik** — Kubernetes-native OIDC/SAML identity provider.
- Helm chart deployment to k8s cluster
- Backend: PostgreSQL (shared cluster instance) + Redis
- Protocols: OIDC, SAML 2.0, LDAP (read-only)

### Key design properties

**No cloud dependency:** All user accounts, TOTP seeds, and sessions live in Authentik on the cluster.
Nothing contacts Google or Apple unless the operator explicitly configures upstream providers.

**Chained upstream providers (optional):**
User → Authentik (local IdP) → [optional: Google/GitHub/Apple upstream]
Services only trust Authentik tokens — they never talk directly to upstream providers.
If upstream is unreachable, local Authentik credentials work as fallback transparently.

**SSO as secondary method (not primary replacement):**
Services are configured to accept EITHER local service credentials OR SSO.
Per-service primary auth (password, password + TOTP) remains available.
MFA enforcement moves to Authentik — user enters credentials + TOTP once at Authentik,
which issues a session token services trust. Services no longer need per-service MFA.

**WAN-offline resilience:**
Local Authentik accounts work without internet. Cloud upstream (if configured) is opportunistic.

### Service integrations
- Nextcloud — `user_oidc` app; local Nextcloud accounts and SSO accounts coexist, linkable to same user
- Future self-hosted services — OIDC/SAML as available; LDAP read-only for services that support only LDAP
- Proxmox — OIDC realm for sidecar/web UI login (optional, operator auth remains primary)

### Deployment components
- Authentik Helm chart (values.yaml managed in repo)
- PostgreSQL database: `authentik` schema in cluster PostgreSQL instance
- Redis: dedicated or shared cluster Redis
- Ingress: `auth.<cluster-domain>` via Headscale/internal DNS
- Initial admin account provisioned via forge-init-authentik.sh (KeePass-gated)

### Credential integration (Phase 1.P)
Authentik admin credentials stored in master KeePass.
Service OIDC client secrets stored in forge-autonomous.kdbx child DB.
Key rotation via forge-rotate-credential.sh with _rotate_oidc_secret() handler.

### Authorization constraints
- AD-060 applies: autonomous ops never wield Authentik admin credentials
- Authentik admin access is operator-only (KeePass gate)
- OIDC client secrets for services are service-level credentials (forge-autonomous child DB scope)

### Dependencies
- Phase 1.P (credential hierarchy) — for OIDC client secret storage and rotation
- Phase 1.Q (node provisioning) — cluster nodes must exist before Helm deploy
- k8s cluster operational with ingress controller

## Roadmap Overview

### Three Processes — Three Package Types

| Process | Package | Phases | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Forging** | Forge package | Phase 0–3 + Phase 1.F | Bare hardware → first operational hatchery |
| **Hatchery Process** | Spawn package | Phase 12.E | Hatchery → broodling joins without conflict |
| **Stargate Process** | Phoenix package | Phase 9 + Phase C/D | Failed node → identity resurrected |

### Four Tracks

**Forging Foundation (Phases 0–3, Phase 1.F)**
Establish the metadata model and all Phase A tooling. Culminates in the forge
package — a self-contained archive that takes bare hardware to an operational
broodforge hatchery via eight automated phases.

**Track 1 — Cell-Scoped Foundation (Phases 6–12.E)**
Complete the single-cell documentation, reconstruction, and spawn capability.
Includes:
- Phase 9 (Stargate Process) — phoenix playbooks that reconstitute a failed node's
  identity on new hardware
- Phase 12.E (Hatchery Process) — spawn package that a broodling runs after bare
  Proxmox install to join the hatchery without VMID, IP, or hostname conflicts
All schemas in this track carry `cell_id` (federation-readiness gate).

**Track 2 — Expanded State Model (Phases 13–18)**
Add the new state categories: Hardware, Platform, Cluster, Storage,
External Dependencies, Data Protection, Observability, Capability, Federation State.

**Track 3 — Digital Twin and Federation (Phases 19–25)**
Build the Digital Twin platform, federation architecture, federated reconstruction,
and continuous assessment capability.

**Track 4 — Autonomous Operations (Phase 26)**
Close the detect → propose → approve → execute → reassess loop. The assessment
engine has always found and scored gaps; Track 4 adds the ability to act on them,
always gated by explicit human approval. No autonomous action without a recorded
operator decision.

Track 2 begins after Phase 12.E completes the single-cell + expansion foundation.
Track 3 begins after Phase 18 completes the expanded state model.
Track 4 begins after Track 3 and requires Phase 24 (continuous assessment) running.

---

## Forging Foundation — Phase 0 through Phase 3

Phases 0–3 constitute the **forging process**: building the Phase A toolchain that
can take bare hardware to an operational broodforge hatchery. These phases are
complete. Phase 1.F (Forge Package Assembly) is the planned capstone.

### Phase 1.F — Forge Package Assembly *(Forging Process capstone)*

*Assembles all Phase A tooling into a single self-contained forge package — the
artifact an operator downloads and runs on bare Proxmox to forge the first hatchery.*

- [x] 1.F.1: `forge-pack.sh` — assembles forge package from current repo state:
      discovery scripts, planners, generators, opentofu/, ansible/, forge.sh + phases,
      forge-workbook.html template, lib/ (checkpoint, validation, failure-package)
- [x] 1.F.2: `forge.sh` — orchestrated entry point with 8 phases:
      phase-00 (discover) → phase-01 (plan) → phase-02 (validate, RED blocks) →
      phase-03 (host config) → phase-04 (VMs) → phase-05 (k3s) →
      phase-06 (Flux GitOps) → phase-07 (intelligence layer) → phase-08 (verify + commit)
- [x] 1.F.3: Forge workbook (HTML) — tracks forge execution with same checkpoint/status
      pattern as spawn and phoenix workbooks; committed to Forgejo on completion
- [x] 1.F.4: `forge-manifest.json` — cell identity snapshot embedded in package:
      declares cell_id, naming convention, hardware requirements, storage config,
      secret registry paths, target VM set (minimum viable broodforge stack only)
- [x] 1.F.5: Minimum viable forge validation — phase-02 checks that hardware meets
      minimum requirements for the broodforge stack (doc engine + assessment engine);
      user applications are not included in the forge package (added via GitOps after)
- [x] 1.F.5a: **Proxmox subscription nag suppression** — `lib/pve-suppress-nag.sh`:
      Patches the Proxmox web UI JavaScript to remove the non-enterprise subscription
      popup. Applied during phase-03 (host config) as part of standard host hardening.

      Implementation: patches `/usr/share/javascript/proxmox-widget-toolkit/proxmoxlib.js`
      to neutralise the `Ext.Msg.show` call that renders the subscription dialog.
      Idempotent — detects if already applied and exits cleanly.

      Persistence: installs a dpkg post-invoke hook at
      `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/85pve-nag-suppress` that re-applies the patch whenever
      `proxmox-widget-toolkit` or `pve-manager` packages are updated, so the
      suppression survives Proxmox upgrades without operator intervention.

      Note: Proxmox Community Edition (VE without subscription) is fully functional
      and free to use. The subscription nag is a commercial reminder, not a licence
      restriction. This script removes the UI interruption for homelab operators who
      do not hold an enterprise subscription.

- [x] 1.F.6: **KeePass initialisation at forge time** — phase-03 (host config) prompts
      the operator to set the KeePass master password before any secrets are generated:
      - Broodforge offers a generated readable passphrase as the default suggestion
        (format: `Capital.word.phrase.9` — 20-30 chars, leading capital, lowercase,
        period separators, trailing digit; see AD-043)
      - Operator may accept the suggestion, enter their own, or open the KeePass
        built-in generator for an alternative format
      - Password confirmed by re-entry; never stored by broodforge
      - KeePass database initialised and populated with generated service credential
        entries (paths only established here; values filled during service deployment)
      - Operator selects whether to embed the database in subsequent spawn/phoenix
        packages (embedded = convenient but requires master password at gate;
        path-based = database stays off the package entirely)
- [x] 1.F.7: **Readable passphrase generator** (`lib/passphrase.py`) — stdlib only:
      Generates passwords in the `Capital.word.phrase.9` format from a curated word list.
      Used for master password suggestion, initial service credentials, and any
      operator-facing password output. Character set: A-Z (leading only), a-z, 0-9, `.`
- [x] 1.F.8: **Service password compatibility detector** — if a service deployment phase
      fails with an authentication or credential-related error, the detector:
      - Matches the failure pattern against known incompatibility signatures
        (common patterns: service rejects `.` or `_` in passwords)
      - Offers to regenerate the affected credential as a plain alphanumeric password
        (letters + digits only, same length range — KeePass default format)
      - Retries the failed deployment phase with the new credential
      - Records the service name and character restriction in service-catalog metadata
        so the restriction is applied automatically in future deployments
      - The service-specific format override is stored in service-catalog.yaml as
        `password_format: alphanumeric` for any service known to require it
- [x] 1.F.8a: **Headscale auto-configuration** — installed and configured during phase-03
      (host config) so the hatchery is the tailnet coordinator from the moment it is forged:

      **Installation:**
        Download headscale binary (or apt install headscale if available in repos)
        Generate headscale config: server_url, listen_addr, db_path, log_level
        server_url derived from the hatchery's discovered WAN/LAN address + port 8080
        TLS: configured with self-signed cert for initial operation; operator can
        supply a proper cert or configure ACME after forging
        systemd service created and enabled: `headscale serve`

      **Initial setup:**
        Create a broodforge user/namespace in Headscale:
          `headscale users create broodforge`
        Register the hatchery's own Tailscale client with its own Headscale:
          `tailscale up --login-server https://{hatchery-address}:8080`
          (the hatchery is the first node on its own tailnet)
        Record the Headscale server URL in bootstrap-state.json as
          `network_topology.headscale_url`
        Store the Headscale API key in KeePass:
          `headscale apikeys create` → stored at
          `Infrastructure/headscale/api-key`
        The hatchery's tailnet IP (100.64.0.1 or similar) is also recorded in
          bootstrap-state.json alongside its LAN IP

      **Auth key generation for spawn packages:**
        When spawn-planner.py runs in WAN mode, it calls:
          `headscale authkeys generate --expiration 1h --user broodforge`
        The resulting key (a short string, typeable or pasteable) is embedded in
        the spawn package. It is single-use and expires — not stored in KeePass.

      **LAN vs WAN detection:**
        spawn-planner.py tries a direct connection to the broodling's reported IP.
        If unreachable within 5 seconds, prompts the operator:
          "Broodling appears unreachable on LAN. Use WAN mode (Headscale)?"
        Operator can also set --wan or --lan explicitly.

- [x] 1.F.8b: **Split-horizon DNS server (dnsmasq)** — deployed in phase-03 (host config),
      before any VMs exist, so DNS is available from the moment the hatchery can serve LAN:

      **Installation and configuration:**
        apt install dnsmasq
        Generate /etc/dnsmasq.conf from dns-registry.yaml:
          - One `address=/{fqdn}/{lan-ip}` line per dns-registry.yaml entry
          - `server=8.8.8.8` and `server=1.1.1.1` for upstream forwarding
          - `domain={operator-domain}` to make unqualified names resolvable
          - `listen-address={hatchery-lan-ip}` to bind to the LAN interface
        Generate via `proxmox-bootstrap/generate-dnsmasq-config.py`:
          reads dns-registry.yaml → writes /etc/dnsmasq.d/broodforge.conf
          Idempotent: re-run after any dns-registry.yaml update to reload config
        systemctl enable --now dnsmasq
        Update Proxmox host /etc/resolv.conf to point at itself (127.0.0.1)

      **The operator provides their domain during phase-01 (plan):**
        forge-planner.py asks:
          "Your domain name (e.g. home.example.com): _"
        Stored in bootstrap-state.json as `host_identity.domain`.
        All node hostnames in the deployment use this domain suffix:
          hatchery.home.example.com, forgejo.home.example.com, etc.
        FQDN stored as `host_identity.fqdn` — the canonical address for all
        inbound connections (Headscale, Forgejo, and any WAN-reachable service).

      **Split-horizon behaviour:**
        LAN clients with hatchery as DNS:   `hatchery.home.example.com` → LAN IP
        WAN clients using public DNS:        `hatchery.home.example.com` → WAN IP
        Same FQDN, same spawn package, same Headscale URL — works from everywhere.

      **Router/firewall requirements (operator-configured, not automated):**
        Port forwarding: 8080 (Headscale) → hatchery LAN IP
        External DNS A record: `hatchery.{domain}` → operator's WAN IP
        The forge wizard reminds the operator of these requirements but cannot
        configure the upstream router automatically (out of scope for forge).

- [x] 1.F.8c: **External DNS auto-update** — for operators with dynamic WAN IPs:

      **Tool selection:**
        Primary: **dns-lexicon** (pip install dns-lexicon) — 90+ providers, actively
          maintained, unified CLI/API. Providers: Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Namecheap,
          Route53, Porkbun, Gandi, OVH, DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, and 80+ more.
        Special case: **DuckDNS** — handled via a single HTTPS GET (no lexicon needed),
          suitable for operators who want a free subdomain rather than their own domain.
        DO NOT USE: inadyn — archived Oct 2025, no longer maintained.

      **Squarespace registrar note:**
        Squarespace exposes no DNS API. Operators with Squarespace-registered domains
        must delegate DNS management to Cloudflare (change nameservers in Squarespace
        dashboard → "Use Custom Nameservers" → enter Cloudflare NS records). After
        delegation, all DNS is managed via Cloudflare API — broodforge treats it as
        a standard Cloudflare provider. See docs/CLOUDFLARE-SETUP.md.

      **forge-planner.py asks:**
        "Is your WAN IP static or dynamic?"
        If dynamic: presents provider selection menu:
          1. Cloudflare (recommended — works for any registrar, including Squarespace)
          2. DuckDNS (free subdomain — no own domain needed)
          3. Other provider (Namecheap, GoDaddy, Route53, Porkbun, etc.) via dns-lexicon
          4. Skip — I will manage DNS records manually

      **Implementation:**
        `proxmox-bootstrap/setup_ddns.py` — interactive configuration wizard:
          Walks operator through provider selection, credential entry, and
          writes config to /etc/broodforge/ddns.conf.
          Credentials stored in KeePass; references stored in bootstrap-state.json.
          Tests the update before saving (makes a real DNS call to verify credentials).
        `proxmox-bootstrap/update-dns.py` — update script (called by systemd timer):
          Detects current WAN IP (curl ifconfig.me / ipinfo.io, with fallback)
          Compares to cached last-known IP (/var/lib/broodforge/last-wan-ip)
          If changed: calls dns-lexicon or DuckDNS GET to update A record
          Logs outcome to systemd journal
          On failure: logs and retries on next timer tick (does not crash)
        systemd timer: broodforge-ddns.timer — runs every 5 minutes
          OnBootSec=60 (initial delay to let network settle)
          OnUnitActiveSec=5min

      **Configuration stored in bootstrap-state.json:**
        `network_topology.ddns_provider` — "cloudflare" | "duckdns" | "lexicon:{name}" | null
        `network_topology.ddns_zone` — the DNS zone/domain being managed
        `network_topology.ddns_record` — the specific A record being updated (e.g. "hatchery")
        `network_topology.ddns_credential_reference` — KeePass path for API token/key

        delegation walkthrough.

- [x] 1.F.8d: **Let's Encrypt TLS certificate automation** — runs after DNS is configured
      (1.F.8b + 1.F.8c); tool and method depend on which DNS provider was selected:

      **Cloudflare path:**
        Install certbot + python3-certbot-dns-cloudflare (apt)
        Write /etc/broodforge/cloudflare.ini using API token from KeePass
          (chmod 600 — certbot refuses to read world-readable credentials files)
        Issue wildcard cert:
          certbot certonly --dns-cloudflare
            --dns-cloudflare-credentials /etc/broodforge/cloudflare.ini
            --dns-cloudflare-propagation-seconds 30
            -d {fqdn} -d "*.{domain}"
            --email {operator-email} --agree-tos --non-interactive
        Certs land at /etc/letsencrypt/live/{fqdn}/fullchain.pem + privkey.pem
        certbot.timer (installed by certbot) handles auto-renewal
        Deploy hook written to /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/:
          Reloads headscale and nginx after each successful renewal

      **DuckDNS path:**
        Install acme.sh (curl https://get.acme.sh | sh)
        Issue wildcard cert:
          DuckDNS_Token={token from KeePass}
          acme.sh --issue --dns dns_duckdns
            -d {subdomain}.duckdns.org -d "*.{subdomain}.duckdns.org"
            --server letsencrypt --dnssleep 60
        Install cert to stable path /etc/broodforge/ssl/ with --install-cert
        acme.sh cron entry handles auto-renewal (added during install)
        Reload command: systemctl reload headscale + sync-cert-to-k8s.sh

      **Both paths — Headscale TLS config:**
        forge.sh writes the cert paths into /etc/headscale/config.yaml after
        cert issuance; Headscale is (re)started with TLS enabled

      **k3s ClusterIssuer (deployed in phase-06 Flux bootstrap):**
        Cloudflare: ClusterIssuer with dns01.cloudflare solver + k8s secret from
          Cloudflare API token (written from KeePass during phase-06)
        DuckDNS: No native cert-manager DNS-01 support; `setup_tls.py` generates
          a site-specific `sync-cert-to-k8s.sh` (via `render_sync_cert_sh()`) with
          cert paths embedded; a generic fallback version in proxmox-bootstrap/
          reads cert paths from env vars / /etc/broodforge/ssl-config and exits 2
          (FORGE_INCOMPLETE) when TLS is not yet configured, so the remediation
          engine records the right status rather than claiming silent success;
          script is wired into acme.sh --reloadcmd and also runs as a weekly
          k8s CronJob to catch any drift

      **SSL config stored in bootstrap-state.json:**
        network_topology.ssl_provider: "certbot" | "acme.sh"
        network_topology.ssl_method:   "dns-01-cloudflare" | "dns-01-duckdns"
        network_topology.ssl_cert_path: path to fullchain.pem
        network_topology.ssl_key_path:  path to privkey.pem

- [x] 1.F.9: **Timezone preference at forge time** — phase-01 (plan) prompts the
      operator to confirm or set their local timezone:
      - Auto-detected from the host OS if available
      - Stored in `bootstrap-state.json` as `vm_defaults.timezone`
      - Used by all documentation engine output (all timestamps show both UTC and local)
      - Updatable after forging via `engine.py --set-timezone` without requiring a rebuild
- [x] 1.F.10: **Backup destination setup at forge time** — phase-01 (plan) walks the
      operator through configuring restic + rclone backup destinations:
      - At least one destination required before forge proceeds (secrets must be backed up)
      - Local destinations (filesystem path, USB mount point) need no credentials
      - Cloud destinations require an API key, Application Key, or OAuth token — not
        username/password; operator directed to docs/CLOUD-STORAGE-SETUP.md for setup
      - Destinations defined as an **ordered chain** per layer; no limit on chain depth
      - Each destination attempted in sequence; each upload independently verified
      - If a destination fails, the next in the chain is attempted automatically;
        the failure is reported to the operator but does not halt the process
      - If every destination in the chain fails for a layer: RED alarm surfaced
        to operator via log, workbook, and next assessment run — never silent
      - All backups encrypted by default with restic (encryption is mandatory, not optional);
        encryption password per restic repo stored in KeePass and retrieved by secrets
        broker at backup time — operator never manually handles backup decryption keys
      - Separate choices for: (a) secrets / KeePass DB, (b) configuration state,
        (c) application data volumes (opt-in; not configured by default)
      - Retention policy: number of versions to keep (default: 5); permanent checkpoint option
      - All backup config stored in bootstrap-state.json as first-class readiness metadata
- [x] 1.F.11: Documentation: `FORGING.md` — operator runbook covering prerequisites,
      running forge-pack.sh on the repo, copying forge package to target host,
      executing forge.sh, verifying hatchery is operational

### Phase 1.G — Guided Setup Framework *(cross-cutting: forge, spawn, phoenix)*

*A shared configuration guidance engine used by all three deployment packages.
At every manual prompt the auto-suggestion is displayed and revised as the operator
makes choices. Conflicts are detected and surfaced before commitment.*

**Four configuration modes:**

| Mode | Operator interaction | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Autonomous** (default) | None — all settings calculated automatically | Standard deployment |
| **IP-Selective** | Choose IP addressing only; everything else is automatic | Operator has a specific IP plan |
| **Group-Manual** | Group selector → configure chosen groups manually, rest is automatic | Operator wants control over specific areas |
| **Full Manual** | Walk through all settings with auto-suggestions | Complete control |

**Setting groups (available in Group-Manual and Full Manual modes):**

| Group | Settings covered |
|---|---|
| Network | Management CIDR, gateway, bridge names, VLAN IDs, DNS, Headscale URL |
| Storage | ZFS pool topology, pool name, datastore names, disk assignment |
| VM Sizing | VMID block, per-VM RAM/CPU/disk, placement constraints |
| Identity | Hostname, domain, FQDN, cell_id, naming convention |
| Security | KeePass location, password format, SSH key references |
| k3s | Pod/service CIDR, CNI plugin, initial role (server/worker) |
| Backup | Restic destinations, retention policy, DDNS provider |

**Suggestion revision:** when the operator overrides a setting, all downstream
auto-suggestions are revised to remain logically consistent. Example: choosing
`192.168.50.0/24` as the management CIDR causes all subsequent VM IP suggestions
to come from that range; choosing a custom pool name causes all datastore references
to use that name.

**Conflict detection:** before accepting each override, the engine checks:
- VMID collisions with existing or other declared VMs
- IP address collisions with DNS registry or other declared VMs
- Subnet overlaps with k3s pod/service CIDR or other networks
- RAM allocation exceeding host total RAM
- ZFS pool or bridge names that already exist on the host
Warnings are shown with specific conflict details. The operator may still proceed.

- [x] 1.G.1: `proxmox-bootstrap/guided_setup.py` — core engine:
      `SETTING_GROUPS` — dict defining the seven groups and their constituent field paths
      `GuidedSetupSession` — session class that tracks:
        mode (autonomous|ip-selective|group-manual|full-manual)
        selected_groups (set of group names for group-manual mode)
        choices (field_path → {value, source: 'auto'|'manual'})
        warnings (accumulated conflict messages)
      `suggest(field_path, session)` — returns auto-suggestion revised from current choices;
        subnet changes cascade to IP suggestions; hostname changes cascade to FQDN; etc.
      `set_value(field_path, value, session)` → list[str] conflict warnings;
        records choice; triggers suggestion revision for dependent fields
      `check_conflicts(field_path, value, session)` → list[str] warning messages

- [x] 1.G.2: Group selector interface:
      `select_groups(session)` — displays group table with current auto-suggestions for
        a representative field in each group; operator toggles groups on/off;
        returns the set of groups to configure manually
      `prompt_field(field_path, label, session, choices=None)` → value;
        shows auto-suggestion, optional discrete choices, accepts free-text or selection;
        calls set_value() and surfaces any conflicts before returning

- [x] 1.G.3: IP-Selective mode specialization:
      Runs autonomously except for the Network group;
      `run_ip_selective(session)` — prompts only for CIDR, gateway, and VM IP assignments;
        all other settings auto-calculated; subsequent IP suggestions revised from choices

- [x] 1.G.3b: Network profiles (setup_network.py):
      LanNetworkConfig / WanNetworkConfig dataclasses; suggest_lan/wan() with field
      revision (cidr→gateway, domain→fqdn, dns_provider→tls_provider);
      validate_lan/wan_config() with errors/warnings; plan_migration_to_wan()
      (7-step plan, router step non-autonomous); plan_migration_to_lan() with
      preserve_headscale option; lan/wan_config_to_state() serialization;
      apply_network_config_to_state(); generate_dnsmasq_config() for both profiles.
      Schema: network_topology.profile + wan_config + lan_config + ssl_provider enum updated.
- [x] 1.G.4: Wire into forge (Phase 1.F):
      forge_planner.py (library) + forge-planner.py (CLI): ForgePlannerSession,
      step0_set_setup_mode, step1_run_guided_setup (autonomous/ip-selective/
      group-manual/full-manual), step2_set_identity, step3_set_network_profile,
      record_manual_field, build_forge_manifest. Produces forge-manifest.json
      with setup_overrides embedded for manual choices. (64 tests)

- [x] 1.G.5: Wire into spawn (Phase 12.E):
      SpawnPlannerSession extended with guided_session + setup_overrides fields.
      step_guided_setup() helper (autonomous no-op; ip-selective pre-populates;
      group-manual + full-manual record field_values). Step 0.5 in spawn-planner.py
      CLI offers guided setup between network mode and execution mode.
      build_spawn_plan() embeds setup_overrides in spawn-plan.json.

- [x] 1.G.6: Wire into phoenix (Phase 9):
      phoenix_guided_setup.py: PhoenixGuidedSetupSession, restoration_wave_options,
      step0_set_restoration_scope (full/partial with wave selection),
      step1_run_identity_overrides (hostname/domain/fqdn/cell_id overrides with
      conflict detection), apply_overrides_to_playbook (scope filter + identity
      update + setup_overrides audit trail), build_phoenix_guided_session factory.
      phoenix-planner.py CLI. (63 tests)

**6.B — Backup Infrastructure** *(restic + rclone; KeePass, config state, app data)*

- [x] 6.B.1: `proxmox-bootstrap/setup-backup.py` — interactive backup configuration wizard:
      - Installs restic and rclone on the host if not present
      - Configures one or more backup layers:
          (a) Secrets / KeePass DB — always enabled when any destination configured
          (b) Configuration state — enabled by default
          (c) Application data volumes — opt-in per volume at service setup
      - For each layer, builds an **ordered destination chain** (no limit on length):
          → Enter destinations one at a time; add as many as desired
          → Each destination attempted in sequence when the previous one fails
          → All attempted; failures reported but chain continues; all-fail = RED
      - Local destinations: filesystem path or USB mount point (no credentials)
      - Cloud destinations: provider selection → API credential entry → rclone config
          written to `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`; restic repo initialised at destination
          Cloud destinations require API key / OAuth / Application Key — not user+password
          (see `docs/CLOUD-STORAGE-SETUP.md`)
      - **Per-backup unique secrets (non-KeePass layers)**:
          Each individual backup run generates a new unique restic repo password via
          `restic key add` + `restic key remove` (rewraps the master key; no data
          re-encryption). Stored in KeePass at a timestamped path per component:
            `Backup/{layer}/{component}/{YYYY-MM-DD_HH_MM_SS}/repo-password`
          A `current` alias key is also maintained:
            `Backup/{layer}/{component}/current` → latest timestamp subdirectory
          Secrets broker uses the snapshot timestamp to look up the exact key for
          any given snapshot at restore time. After `restic forget` prunes a snapshot,
          the corresponding KeePass entry is removed automatically.
          KeePass DB backup is exempt — its auth method (master password or configured
          token/key file) is never subject to per-backup rotation.
      - **KeePass DB backup — no restic layer**: the `.kdbx` file is already AES-256
          encrypted by KeePass; backed up as a plain rclone file copy to each configured
          destination; adding restic encryption would create a circular dependency (need
          the repo password from KeePass to decrypt backup of KeePass — irrecoverable)
      - **KeePass backup transport credentials** stored in `forge-manifest.json`, NOT in
          KeePass — the one exception to the "packages carry only KeePass references" rule;
          these credentials are embedded in forge/spawn/phoenix packages so a bare machine
          can retrieve the KeePass DB before KeePass is available
      - **Secrets broker configuration**: wizard records which KeePass path templates map
          to which components/layers so that automated backup and restore require no manual
          secret entry beyond the initial master password gate
      - **Space-aware component routing**: wizard records the target snapshot retention
          count and estimated component sizes; at runtime the backup engine probes
          available space before each run and routes individual components to destinations
          with sufficient room (see 6.B.3 for execution detail)
      - Retention policy per layer: number of snapshots to keep (default 5);
          permanent checkpoint: any snapshot can be tagged `checkpoint` and is
          excluded from rotation regardless of retention count
      - **Naming convention enforced by wizard**: all repo paths, KeePass key paths,
          snapshot tags, and KeePass DB filenames are constructed programmatically
          from cell_id, component metadata, and UTC timestamps — operators do not
          name backup artifacts; see 6.B.2 naming convention for the full scheme
      - All configuration serialised into `bootstrap-state.json` backup_config section

- [x] 6.B.2: `backup_config` section in `bootstrap-state-schema.json` — schema for:

      **Naming convention** (enforced programmatically; operators do not name artifacts manually):
        Component prefixes: `kdbx` | `cell-config` | `node-{hostname}` | `vm-{name}-{vmid}`
          | `ct-{name}-{ctid}` | `vol-{vm_name}-{vol_name}` | `svc-{service_name}`
        Timestamp format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH_MM_SS` (UTC; underscores; matches project convention)
        Hash: 8 hex chars — SHA-256 of file content (KeePass files) or first 8 of UUID/snapshot ID
        Restic repo paths: `{destination_root}/{cell_id}/{layer}/{component_prefix}/`
        KeePass DB files: `kdbx_{cell_id}_{timestamp}_{hash8}.kdbx`
        Snapshot set IDs: `{cell_id}_{timestamp}_{run_hash8}` (UUID first 8 chars)
        Restic snapshot tags: `cell:{cell_id}`, `set:{snapshot_set_id}`,
          `component:{prefix}`, `layer:{layer}`, `run:{timestamp}`
        KeePass key paths: `Backup/{layer}/{component_prefix}/{timestamp}/repo-password`
          and `Backup/{layer}/{component_prefix}/current` (alias to latest)

      - Per-layer destination chain (ordered array; unlimited length):
          For config/appdata layers — each entry:
            `{type, rclone_remote, restic_repo_root, restic_repo_password_keepass_prefix,
              retention_count}`
            Restic repo path assembled as: `{restic_repo_root}/{cell_id}/{layer}/{component}/`
          For secrets/KeePass layer — each entry:
            `{type, rclone_remote, kdbx_destination_root}`
            Destination file named: `kdbx_{cell_id}_{timestamp}_{hash8}.kdbx`
            (no restic layer; transport credentials stored in forge-manifest.json)
      - Permanent checkpoint tag name (default: `checkpoint`)
      - Layer-level `all_failed_policy`: `alert` | `block_assessment` (default: both)
      - Per-layer backup history (appended on each run; trimmed to last 100 entries):
          `{run_at, snapshot_set_id, destinations_attempted, destinations_succeeded,
            consecutive_all_fail_count, components: [{component_id, component_prefix,
            destination, restic_snapshot_id, keepass_key_path, size_bytes, verified,
            routed_reason}]}`
          `snapshot_set_id`: `{cell_id}_{timestamp}_{run_hash8}` — human-readable;
          links all component snapshots belonging to the same logical backup point
      - Space routing metadata per component per run (embedded in components[]):
          `routed_reason`: `primary` | `space_fallback` | `chunked_split`

- [x] 6.B.3: `proxmox-bootstrap/run-backup.py` — backup execution engine:

      **Naming — all names constructed programmatically, never entered manually:**
      - Restic repo path: `{restic_repo_root}/{cell_id}/{layer}/{component_prefix}/`
          e.g. `b2:cell-backup/proxmox-cell-a/config/vm-forgejo-101/`
      - KeePass DB copy: `kdbx_{cell_id}_{timestamp}_{sha256_of_file[:8]}.kdbx`
          e.g. `kdbx_proxmox-cell-a_2026-06-01_03_00_00_a3f2b891.kdbx`
      - Snapshot set ID: `{cell_id}_{timestamp}_{snapshot_set_uuid[:8]}`
          e.g. `proxmox-cell-a_2026-06-01_03_00_00_f7c1d3a2`
      - Restic snapshot tags applied at creation: `cell:{cell_id}`, `set:{snapshot_set_id}`,
          `component:{component_prefix}`, `layer:{layer}`, `run:{timestamp}`
      - KeePass key path: `Backup/{layer}/{component_prefix}/{timestamp}/repo-password`

      **Per-backup secret rotation:**
      - For each component being backed up, generates a new unique passphrase
      - Adds it to the restic repo: `restic key add` (new key now unlocks the repo)
      - Stores it in KeePass at the timestamped path:
          `Backup/{layer}/{component_prefix}/{YYYY-MM-DD_HH_MM_SS}/repo-password`
      - Updates the `current` alias in KeePass to point to the new timestamp path
      - Removes the previous key from the repo: `restic key remove` (old password
          no longer works; only the newly generated key is valid going forward)
      - On pruning (after `restic forget`): removes the corresponding KeePass entry
          for each pruned snapshot's timestamp path; `current` always points to latest
      - KeePass master password gate fires once per session; all subsequent secret
          lookups and key rotations are automatic
      - **KeePass database backup**: triggered whenever configuration state backup runs;
          executed as a plain rclone copy of the `.kdbx` file — no restic layer, no key
          rotation; transport credentials read from `forge-manifest.json` (not KeePass);
          KeePass is already AES-256 encrypted and requires no additional encryption layer

      **Space-aware component routing:**
      - Before backing up each component, probes available space at each destination
          in the chain using rclone's `about` command (or filesystem `statvfs` for local)
      - Estimates required space: last snapshot size × 1.1 (10% growth headroom)
      - Routing logic per component:
          1. Primary destination has space → back up there (routed_reason: `primary`)
          2. Primary is full or insufficient → try next destination in chain
             (routed_reason: `space_fallback`)
          3. No single destination has sufficient space, but multiple have partial space:
             → Split by sub-components (e.g., each volume backed up independently to
                whichever destination has room for that volume)
             → Each sub-component gets its own restic repo, its own key rotation, its
                own KeePass path, and its own backup_history entry
             → The parent `snapshot_set_id` links all sub-component snapshots so restore
                knows they belong to the same logical backup point
             (routed_reason: `chunked_split`)
          4. Even sub-component splitting cannot fit within available space across all
             destinations → surfaces as a human-required decision; backup run records
             a BLOCKED status for the affected component; other components continue
      - All routing decisions (destination chosen, available space at run time,
          routed_reason) recorded in the component entry in `backup_history`
      - Restore reads routing from `backup_history` → secrets broker retrieves the
          correct key per component+destination+timestamp → restores each piece
          from its actual destination → assembles the full snapshot set automatically

      **Ordered destination chain execution:**
      - After space-aware routing determines where each component goes, backs up each
          component to its assigned destination
      - On completion runs `restic stats` to verify upload integrity (snapshot count
          and size must be consistent with expectations)
      - If verification fails or destination errors: logs with full error detail,
          marks destination as failed in this run, moves to next destination in chain
      - If all destinations fail for a layer:
          → Writes RED entry to backup_history
          → Increments `consecutive_all_fail_count`
          → Emits a structured failure record visible in the next assessment run
          → Never fails silently; surfaced in workbook, readiness report, and alerts

      **Retention and checkpoints:**
      - Applies `restic forget --prune --keep-last N` per destination after each
          successful backup (only on destinations that succeeded this run)
      - After pruning: removes corresponding per-snapshot KeePass entries; updates
          `current` alias to remain valid
      - Snapshots tagged `checkpoint` are excluded from forget regardless of N
      - Prompts operator to create a checkpoint if none exists after > 7 days

      **Run trigger:**
      - Triggered by assessment engine on completion of a full cluster assessment
      - Can also be run manually: `python3 proxmox-bootstrap/run-backup.py [--layer secrets|config|appdata]`
      - Dry-run mode: `--dry-run` shows what would be backed up, to which destinations,
          with current space probe results and routing decisions (no writes made)

- [x] 6.B.4: **Simple mode** — one wizard, uniform policy across layers:
      - Operator defines a single ordered destination chain that applies to all layers
      - Per-layer overrides available but not required
      - Recommended starting point; detailed mode layers on top as needed

- [x] 6.B.5: **Detailed mode** — per-node, per-VM, per-container, per-volume heterogeneous policy:
      - Each component defines its own ordered destination chain, retention count,
          and restic repo password (or inherits from parent explicitly)
      - Inheritance chain: cell → node → VM → container → volume; each level can
          override any field while inheriting the rest from the parent
      - Children create a sub-directory prefix at the inherited destination so backup
          data is co-located but separately addressable (`/cell/node/vm/volume/`)
      - Siblings' destination chains auto-suggested as defaults when configuring a new
          sibling (enter once, reuse across all sibling components)
      - Policy inheritance and credential reuse minimise repeated configuration entry
          while maintaining independent restic repos per component (dedup is per-repo)

- [x] 6.B.6: Backup readiness scoring in `readiness.py`:
      - RED: no destination configured for secrets or configuration state layers
      - RED: `consecutive_all_fail_count` ≥ 2 (two consecutive complete-chain failures)
      - RED: last successful backup older than 3× schedule interval
      - ORANGE: last successful backup older than 2× schedule interval
      - ORANGE: any destination in chain has failed in last 3 runs (partial coverage)
      - YELLOW: all destinations healthy but last backup older than 1× schedule interval
      - YELLOW: no permanent checkpoint exists
      - GREEN: all destinations reachable, last backup within schedule, checkpoint exists

- [x] 6.B.7: Backup status in recovery runbook — Appendix H:
      - Per-layer: destination chain with last-run status per destination (✓ / ✗ / skipped),
          last successful backup timestamp, snapshot count, most recent permanent checkpoint
      - All-fail history: if consecutive_all_fail_count > 0, shown prominently
      - Restic repo password KeePass paths listed (for manual recovery reference)

- [x] 6.B.8: `proxmox-bootstrap/restore-from-backup.py` — automated restore engine:

      **Design principle:** maximise automation via secrets broker; operator enters
      master password once at the gate; everything else is automatic.

      **Snapshot discovery and selection:**
      - Probes each configured destination (in chain order) for available restic snapshots
      - Presents snapshot list: timestamp, tag, component, size
      - Defaults to "latest" unless operator specifies a date or checkpoint tag
      - `--latest`, `--checkpoint` (most recent tagged snapshot), `--date YYYY-MM-DD`,
          `--tag NAME` selection flags

      **Automated secret retrieval for per-backup keys:**
      - For each component being restored, reads its `backup_history` entry to find:
          `{destination, restic_snapshot_id, keepass_key_path, routed_reason}`
      - Resolves `keepass_key_path` (the timestamped per-backup path) via secrets broker
          — automatically retrieves the unique key that was current for that specific backup
      - For chunked-split restores: reads all sub-component entries sharing the same
          `snapshot_set_id`; resolves each sub-component's key independently; restores
          each piece from its actual destination; assembles full snapshot set
      - For service-level restores (post-restic): retrieves service credentials from
          KeePass and re-injects into service config — no per-service password re-entry

      **Restore execution:**
      - Restores to target path; verifies file integrity post-restore via `restic check`
      - For chunked-split snapshot sets: restores sub-components in dependency order
          (volumes before containers, containers before VMs), assembles into target path
      - Generates structured restore report: component, destination, snapshot ID,
          timestamp, `routed_reason`, integrity verification result, KeePass path used
      - If a destination is unreachable at restore time, tries other destinations that
          hold the same component (if any — depends on whether backup ran to multiple)
      - Supports `--dry-run` (lists what would be restored, from where, which keys used)
      - Supports `--component` flag: restore a single VM, container, or volume
      - Supports `--snapshot-set` flag: restore all components of a specific backup point
          (identified by `snapshot_set_id` from `backup_history`)

### Phase 7 — Service State

**7.1 — Service Contract Implementation**
- [x] Service Contract YAML spec format
- [x] Initial contracts for all known VMs
- [x] Service contract reader in Tier 2 collector
- [x] Service contract validator (observed vs. declared)
- [x] Dependency graph builder updated to use contracts as primary source

**7.2 — Service State Schema and Collection**
- [x] Finalise `service-state-schema.json` with `cell_id`
- [x] Service state collector
- [x] Service state in Tier 2 manifest
- [x] Service contract completeness in readiness scorer

**7.3 — External Dependency State (Phase 7 addition from v5.0)**
- [x] `data-model/external-dependency-state-schema.json`
- [x] External dependency declaration format (DNS provider, SMTP, cert authority) — `external_dependencies` in bootstrap-state.json; `doc-gen/external_dependencies.py` ExternalDependencyRegistry
- [x] Certificate expiry monitoring (RED ≤ 7d, ORANGE ≤ 30d, YELLOW ≤ 60d) — `_score_external_dependency_state()` in readiness.py
- [x] External dependency section in Recovery Runbook — Appendix G (endpoint, type, required_by, cert expiry with severity callouts)

**7.4 — Recovery Documentation Update (Service Layer)**
- [x] Service contract block per VM in restore sequence: provided interfaces,
      required interfaces, startup_after note, restart commands, secret references,
      per-interface health check checkboxes
- [x] Health check commands derived from contract: curl for HTTP/HTTPS (uses
      url_pattern when available, falls back to vm_ip:port), pg_isready for postgresql,
      nc for smtp, empty for ssh (already in standard block)
- [x] Service restart commands: ssh ubuntu@{ip} 'sudo systemctl restart {svc}'
- [x] Appendix A: edge type legend (SERVICE★/DEPENDS_ON/STORAGE/NETWORK/BACKUP)
      + ★ marker on SERVICE edges to distinguish contract-driven from heuristic

### Phase 8 — Network Topology as Code

- [x] 8.1: Network topology declaration format — `data-model/network-topology-schema.json`
      (bridges, VLANs, firewall policy) + `network_topology_declared` section in
      bootstrap-state-schema.json + canonical fixture in bootstrap-state.json
- [x] 8.2: Network topology collector — `proxmox-bootstrap/network_topology_collector.py`:
      parse_interfaces_file() parses /etc/network/interfaces format;
      collect_observed_bridges() SSHes to host (injectable runner for tests);
      compare_topology() diffs declared vs observed; merge_observed_topology()
      writes drift results back into bootstrap-state.json
- [x] 8.3: Network topology drift detection — compare_topology() returns
      (drift_detected: bool, drift_details: str); merge_observed_topology()
      persists both fields; readiness scorer surfaces as ORANGE/RED
- [x] 8.4: Recovery documentation Wave 0 — build_recovery_runbook() now emits
      a full "Wave 0 — Network Reconstruction" section before the restore sequence:
      per-bridge IP, ports, vlan_aware; verify commands (ip link, ip addr);
      reconstruct commands (ifreload -a from /etc/network/interfaces);
      drift warning if drift_detected; "NOT DECLARED" UNRESOLVED field if absent
- [x] 8.5: Network topology completeness in readiness scorer —
      _score_network_topology_completeness(): YELLOW if not declared; ORANGE if
      drift detected; RED if all declared bridges are missing in observed state

### Phase 9 — Phoenix Playbooks *(Stargate Process — reconstruction scripts)*

These are the playbooks that form the execution layer of the stargate process —
per-wave, per-VM scripts that reconstitute a failed node's identity on new hardware.
See Phase 12.E for the hatchery process playbooks (broodling spawn scripts).

- [x] 9.1: Phoenix playbook format and schema — `data-model/phoenix-playbook-schema.json`:
      schema_version, cell_id, target_node (hostname, role, k3s_role), identity
      (lan_ip, tailnet_ip, vmids, bridge_names, zfs_pool_name), hardware_profile,
      restoration_scope (full|partial|deferred), deferred_services, waves (playbook_wave
      → playbook_step with id, action, commands, validation, method, on_failure, secret_refs),
      estimated_total_minutes, validation_checklist
- [x] 9.2: Playbook generator — `proxmox-bootstrap/phoenix_playbook.py`:
      PhoenixPlaybookGenerator class + build_phoenix_playbook() factory;
      reads manifest (host_identity, vms, dns_registry, network_topology_declared,
      storage_config, provenance_registry); now_fn injectable for tests;
      _zfs_topology_from_disk_count() adapts topology to replacement hardware
- [x] 9.3: Wave 0 (network reconstruction) + Wave 1 (ZFS pool) + Wave 2 (host config) +
      Wave 3 (VM PBS restore, identity-preserving — same VMIDs, IPs, provenance info) +
      Wave 4 (k3s membership + Flux reconciliation) generated with pre-populated commands
- [x] 9.4: Wave 0.5 (template rebuild) playbook — _wave_05_template_rebuild() in
      PhoenixPlaybookGenerator; inserted at wave=2.5 between host config and VM restore;
      _os_variant_for_vm() reads k3s-cluster.yaml server_nodes[].os_variant;
      Ubuntu path: download ISO + qm create + qm template; Talos path scaffolded
- [x] 9.5: Per-VM RECREATE vs RESTORE decision — _vm_is_stateless() checks
      service_contract.backup_job==null AND provenance_registry.tofu_workspace present;
      stateless VMs: RECREATE (tofu apply + Ansible playbook); stateful VMs: RESTORE (qmrestore)
- [x] 9.6: Shell script generator — proxmox-bootstrap/phoenix_scripts.py:
      generate_wave_script(wave) → bash script with checkpoint tracking per step;
      generate_run_all_sh(playbook) → orchestrating entry point that calls each wave script
      in wave-number order with failure detection
- [x] 9.7: Playbook validator — proxmox-bootstrap/phoenix_validator.py:
      validate_playbook() → list of {severity, field, message} findings;
      ERROR: missing required fields, empty waves, duplicate wave/step IDs, invalid enum values,
      empty step commands; WARNING: missing vmids/bridges/pool in identity, non-ascending waves;
      is_valid() and summarise_findings() helper functions
- [x] 9.8: Playbook existence in readiness scorer — _score_phoenix_playbook_existence():
      YELLOW if neither phoenix_playbook nor phoenix_playbook_generated_at is present
      in the manifest; wired into score_graph() alongside other registry gap scorers

**9.T — Talos Alternative Support** *(optional; activate by setting os_variant: talos)*

*Foundation — build and config tooling:*
- [x] 9.T.1: `docs/TALOS-ALTERNATIVE.md` — prerequisites, build procedure for talos-1x-base
        template, talosctl installation, machine config generation, migration checklist
- [x] 9.T.2: `proxmox-bootstrap/build-talos-template.sh` — downloads Talos ISO,
        creates Proxmox VM, converts to template (talos-1x-base, VMID 9001)
- [x] 9.T.3: `proxmox-bootstrap/generate-talos-config.py` — generates talos machine
        configs from k3s-cluster.yaml (control plane + worker patches); stdlib only
- [x] 9.T.4: Talos template entry in bootstrap-state.json template registry
        (talos-1x-base alongside ubuntu-2204-base; separate base_image entry)
- [x] 9.T.5: bootstrap-state-schema.json — add `os_variant` enum (ubuntu | talos)
        to template registry entries and provenance_records
- [x] 9.T.6: doc-gen readiness scorer — YELLOW if os_variant=talos but no Talos
        machine config found in repo (talos-configs/ directory absent)
- [x] 9.T.7: Recovery runbook — emit Talos-specific reconstruction steps
        (talosctl apply-config instead of Ansible) when os_variant=talos
- [x] 9.T.8: Tests for Talos config generator and runbook rendering (57 tests)

*OS transition automation — Ubuntu → Talos:*
- [x] 9.T.9: `proxmox-bootstrap/migrate-k3s-to-talos.py` — automated migration script
        Steps: drain k3s node → snapshot VM → destroy Ubuntu VM → provision Talos VM
        from talos-1x-base template → apply machine config → verify cluster health →
        update bootstrap-state.json os_variant + provenance_records → commit to repo
        Flag: `--dry-run` prints plan without making changes
        Flag: `--skip-snapshot` for test environments where snapshot overhead is unwanted
        Guard: refuses to run if cluster health check fails pre-drain (RED readiness)
- [x] 9.T.10: Pre-migration checklist validator — confirms all prerequisites before
        migration begins: talos-1x-base template exists, machine config generated,
        Velero PVC backup current (ORANGE if any check fails; migration blocked until GREEN)
- [x] 9.T.11: Post-migration verifier — confirms k3s node rejoined cluster, all
        namespaces healthy, Flux reconciliation complete, PVCs reattached;
        writes migration completion record to bootstrap-state.json provenance_records
- [x] 9.T.12: Recovery runbook — "OS Variant Migration" appendix (Appendix I) documents
        all migration attempts from migration_history with per-record detail
        (node, direction, outcome, snapshot_vmid, error) and manual rollback commands.
        Both ODT and HTML renderers. 25 tests.

*OS transition automation — Talos → Ubuntu:*
- [x] 9.T.13: `proxmox-bootstrap/migrate-k3s-to-ubuntu.py` — automated reverse migration
        Steps: drain k3s node → snapshot VM → destroy Talos VM → provision Ubuntu VM
        from ubuntu-2204-base template → apply Cloud-Init + Ansible k3s-server role →
        verify cluster health → update bootstrap-state.json → commit to repo
        Same flags as 9.T.9 (--dry-run, --skip-snapshot)
        Guard: refuses to run if cluster health check fails pre-drain
- [x] 9.T.14: Shared migration library `proxmox-bootstrap/migrate_k3s_lib.py`
        Extract common steps from 9.T.9 and 9.T.13: drain, snapshot, VM destroy,
        health check, provenance record update. Both migration scripts import this.
- [x] 9.T.15: Migration state file `bootstrap-state.json migration_history` array
        Each completed migration appended: from_variant, to_variant, migrated_at,
        migrated_by, snapshot_vmid (for rollback), outcome
- [x] 9.T.16: Rollback procedure — if post-migration verifier fails, restore VM from
        pre-migration snapshot, update os_variant back, re-run health check;
        rollback outcome appended to migration_history (rollback() in migrate_k3s_lib.py)
- [x] 9.T.17: Tests for both migration scripts (mock Proxmox API + mock talosctl/ansible)
        48 tests in test_migration_k3s.py

### Phase 10 — Operational Documentation

- [x] 10.1: Operational documentation class design — `doc-gen/renderers/operational_report.py`;
      seven sections: overall readiness, drift summary, capacity, service health,
      secret completeness, external dependencies, time-sensitive actions
- [x] 10.2: Drift summary renderer — Section 2 reads manifest["drift"] (from compute_drift());
      shows from/to snapshot, severity, changed fields (capped at 30)
- [x] 10.3: Capacity trend renderer — Section 3 reads cpu/memory/storage from manifest;
      ORANGE/RED warnings on RAM ≥90% or storage ≥90% utilization
- [x] 10.4: Service health summary renderer — Section 4 reads manifest["service_state"];
      shows running/stopped/degraded counts and per-service status line
- [x] 10.5: Secret registry completeness renderer — Section 5 reads manifest["secret_registry"];
      shows total/with-path counts; lists secrets missing keepass_path
- [x] 10.6: Wire into engine.py — run_operational() function + `--mode operational` choice;
      loads all registries, computes drift + readiness, renders Operational-Report.html
- [x] 10.7: Scheduled refresh — `proxmox-bootstrap/setup-operational-schedule.sh` installs
      broodforge-operational.service + broodforge-operational.timer (every hour)

### Phase 11 — Capacity Model

- [x] 11.1: Capacity model schema — `capacity_model` section added to bootstrap-state-schema.json:
      thresholds (cpu/ram/storage warn/crit pcts + restoration_headroom_pct),
      observed (snapshot: ram/storage usage pcts + totals), trend (direction + days_to_full)
- [x] 11.2: Capacity tracking — `proxmox-bootstrap/capacity_collector.py`:
      collect_capacity_snapshot() reads cpu/memory/storage from manifest;
      merge_capacity_model() updates bootstrap-state.json with observed + trend
- [x] 11.3: Capacity validation in readiness scorer — _score_capacity_model():
      YELLOW: no capacity_model; YELLOW/ORANGE: RAM/storage above warn/crit threshold
- [x] 11.4: Trend analysis — compute_trend() derives direction (increasing/stable/decreasing)
      and days_to_full projection from ordered historical snapshots; uses linear rate
- [x] 11.5: ORANGE if target host cannot accommodate restored workload —
      check_restoration_headroom() compares sum(VM RAM) vs host RAM × (1 - headroom_pct)

### Phase 12 — Full Single-Cell Reconstruction Test

- [x] 12.1: End-to-end drill framework — `proxmox-bootstrap/reconstruction_drill.py`:
      DrillRecord (per-wave timing, gap tracking), start_drill() factory from phoenix playbook,
      save_drill_record() / get_last_drill() for bootstrap-state persistence,
      `reconstruction_drills[]` schema in bootstrap-state-schema.json;
      `docs/RECONSTRUCTION-DRILL.md` operator guide (live + tabletop modes)
- [x] 12.2: Reconstruction time measurement — DrillRecord.record_wave() tracks
      estimated vs actual minutes per wave; generate_drill_report() produces Markdown
      table with timing comparison and accuracy %; DrillRecord.accuracy_pct property
- [x] 12.3: Gap identification — DrillRecord.gaps_found/gaps_remediated; readiness scorer
      _score_reconstruction_drill(): YELLOW if no drill, YELLOW if > 90 days stale,
      ORANGE if last drill was failed/aborted; wired into score_graph()
- [x] 12.4: Scheduled drill activity — `proxmox-bootstrap/schedule-reconstruction-drill.sh`
      installs broodforge-drill-reminder.timer (fires every 90 days, logs journal reminder)

**Gate:** Phase 12 completion validates the single-cell foundation.
Track 2 begins after Phase 12.

### Phase 12.E — Node Spawn Bootstrap *(Hatchery Process)*

*The existing cluster is the hatchery. Additional nodes — broodlings — are spawned
from it via the **hatchery process**. Phase 12.E adds the ability to run the
hatchery process: the assessment engine produces a **spawn package** — a
self-contained archive of scripts and a reserved-resource data dump — that is
copied to a broodling after bare Proxmox installation and executed there. The
broodling joins the existing Proxmox cluster and k3s cluster without VMID, IP,
or hostname conflicts.*

**Hatchery process vs stargate process:**
The hatchery process (this phase) assigns *new* identity — VMIDs, IPs, hostnames
that don't conflict with anything already in the hatchery.
The stargate process (Phase 9) preserves *existing* identity — the exact VMIDs,
IPs, hostnames, and certs of a node that failed, reconstituted on new hardware.

**Context:** Phase 12 answers "can I rebuild this?" Phase 12.E answers "can I
spawn a broodling into this datacenter?" The assessment engine knows everything
the hatchery has reserved — IPs, VMIDs, hostnames, k3s join tokens, cluster
topology — and encodes that knowledge into the spawn package so the broodling
never needs to ask the operator what is already taken.

- [x] 12.E.1: **Hatchery state reader** — reads `bootstrap-state.json` and queries
      the live Assessment Engine API to extract a point-in-time reservation snapshot:
      all allocated VMIDs, all assigned IPs (from DNS registry + provenance records),
      all hostnames, Proxmox cluster join address, k3s server/worker counts,
      k3s join tokens (worker and server). Produces `spawn-manifest.json`.
      This is the authoritative "what the hatchery has reserved" data dump embedded
      in every spawn package.

- [x] 12.E.2: **Conflict validator** (`proxmox-bootstrap/validate-spawn.py`) —
      run before the spawn package is generated and again on the broodling before
      any deployment action:
      - No VMID collisions (proposed new VMIDs vs all VMIDs in spawn-manifest.json)
      - No IP collisions (proposed new IPs vs all IPs in spawn-manifest.json)
      - No hostname collisions (proposed hostnames vs all hostnames in spawn-manifest.json)
      - Placement policy satisfied (proposed roles are declared for this host type)
      - Capacity check: broodling RAM sufficient for its assigned VM roles
      RED finding on any collision blocks spawn package generation until resolved.
      The validator is designed to be re-run on the broodling from the spawn package
      itself, using only the embedded manifest (no live API access required).

- [x] 12.E.3: **Spawn planner with execution mode gate and service selection**
      (`proxmox-bootstrap/spawn-planner.py`) —

      The planner runs on the hatchery. **Execution mode is the first question**,
      because the answer determines whether service selection happens at all.

      **Step 0 — Network mode (asked before anything else):**

      Because the hatchery runs split-horizon DNS, the Headscale server URL in every
      spawn package is always the hatchery's FQDN (`host_identity.fqdn`):
        `https://hatchery.home.example.com:8080`
      LAN broodlings resolve this to the LAN IP via the hatchery's dnsmasq.
      WAN broodlings resolve this to the WAN IP via public DNS.
      The same spawn package works from both locations without modification.

      The planner still asks which network mode the broodling is on, because
      the SSH discovery path differs (direct IP vs tailnet IP):

      ```
      Is the broodling on the same LAN as the hatchery?
      [auto-detecting — trying {broodling-ip} directly... timeout 5s]

        1. Same LAN  — direct SSH using temporary root password
        2. WAN       — Headscale tailnet (generates auth key; Headscale URL is
                       hatchery.{domain} — already correct for both LAN and WAN)
        3. Specify   — enter broodling IP / hostname manually

      > _
      ```

      **LAN mode:** proceeds with the existing temporary root password flow.
        Broodling is configured to use hatchery as its DNS server (via DHCP or
        static config in spawn package), so `hatchery.{domain}` resolves to LAN IP.

      **WAN mode:** the planner calls:
        `headscale authkeys generate --expiration 1h --user broodforge`
        The auth key and `https://hatchery.{domain}:8080` are embedded in the
        spawn package. phase-00a on the broodling:
          Installs Tailscale: `curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh`
          Registers: `tailscale up --authkey {key}
                                   --login-server https://hatchery.{domain}:8080`
          (The FQDN resolves to WAN IP via public DNS, which routes to Headscale
          via the operator's router port forwarding.)
          Broodling appears on tailnet → hatchery SSHes to its tailnet IP for discovery.
        After spawn completes, Tailscale remains installed — the broodling is a
        permanent tailnet member. Its tailnet IP is recorded in bootstrap-state.json
        alongside its LAN IP (if any).

      **Step 1 — Execution mode (asked after network mode):**

      ```
      How should the spawn package run on the broodling?

        1. Autonomous (default)  — finalise service selection now; spawn.sh runs
                                   without prompting after the KeePass unlock gate
        2. Interactive            — no selection needed now; spawn.sh evaluates the
                                   broodling's hardware at runtime and presents the
                                   service menu there

      > _
      ```

      **If Interactive:** the planner records `execution_mode: interactive` and
      proceeds directly to package assembly. No service selection on the hatchery.
      The package includes all available service scripts. Service selection happens
      entirely on the broodling at execution time against actual hardware.

      **If Autonomous:** the planner continues to Step 2.

      For autonomous mode, the planner also generates a **suggested temporary root
      password** (readable passphrase format) at this point and displays it to the
      operator with the instruction to use it when setting the Proxmox root password
      during installation. The hatchery stores this password in memory for the
      duration of the spawn-planning session so it can use it for password-based SSH
      discovery without the operator re-entering it. The password is NOT stored in
      KeePass — it is temporary, replaced by a proper KeePass-managed credential
      during the spawn process.

      **Step 2 — Service selection (autonomous only):**

      The planner reads the service catalog (`metadata/service-catalog.yaml`) to
      know what the hatchery runs and the broodling's hardware profile to know what fits.

      **Mode 1 — Full mirror:**
      Selects all services that fit the broodling's hardware.
      Services that don't fit are listed with a reason (RAM, disk, dependency) and
      excluded. The operator reviews the exclusion list and confirms or switches mode.

      **Mode 2 — Select by group:**
      Services grouped by category (Infrastructure, Platform, Intelligence,
      Monitoring, Applications). Operator includes/excludes whole groups, then
      fine-tunes individual services within groups.

      **Mode 3 — Select individually:**
      Every service listed with hardware fit status, resource requirements, and
      dependencies. The planner enforces dependencies: selecting nextcloud
      automatically selects longhorn if not already selected.

      **Hardware fit display for each service:**
        [✓] fits — RAM available vs required shown; disk requirements shown
        [!] marginal — fits with reduced VM sizing; operator warned explicitly
        [✗] does not fit — specific shortfall shown (RAM delta, missing disk, etc.)
      Services marked [✗] are excluded regardless of selection.

      **The intelligence baseline is always included and cannot be deselected:**
      Proxmox cluster membership, k3s worker, assessment/doc engine visibility,
      `bootstrap-state.json` contribution. This is the minimum viable participation.

      **Produces `spawn-plan-{hostname}.json` containing:**
      - `disposition.execution_mode` — `autonomous` | `interactive`
      - `disposition.services` — selected service names (autonomous only; empty for interactive)
      - `disposition.mode` — `full-mirror` | `group` | `individual` (autonomous only)
      - `disposition.excluded` — services excluded with reason (autonomous only)
      - Non-conflicting VMID block, IPs, hostnames
      - ZFS pool topology from disk configuration
      - For autonomous: only VM roles, Cloud-Init snippets, Ansible roles for selected services
      - For interactive: full service catalog scripts included; selection deferred to broodling
      - k3s node labels and taints (autonomous: derived from selection; interactive: set at runtime)
      - Proxmox cluster join address (from manifest)
      - k3s join token type: worker always; server only if k3s-server selected (or selectable)
      - If 3rd server node possible: etcd migration plan included in interactive; locked in autonomous

- [x] 12.E.4: **Spawn hardware discovery (autonomous mode only)** — produces
      `hardware-profile-{hostname}.json` before the spawn package is generated.
      This is the input to the spawn planner for hardware-specific adaptation:
      disk topology → ZFS pool type, NIC inventory → bridge definitions, RAM → VM sizing.

      Two discovery paths depending on network mode selected in Step 0 of 12.E.3:

      **LAN mode — password-based SSH (same-network broodling):**
        The spawn planner generates a suggested temporary root password (readable
        passphrase format, e.g. `Ready.to.spawn.7`) at Step 0 selection time.
        The operator uses this password during Proxmox installation.
        The hatchery holds the password in session memory and SSHes directly:
          `python3 spawn_hardware_discovery.py --host {broodling-lan-ip} --password-prompt`
          (password retrieved from session, not re-entered by the operator)
          → `hardware-profile-{hostname}.json`
        If the operator used a different password, they enter it when prompted.
        Password transmitted over the trusted LAN only.
        Valid from: Proxmox installation complete.
        Valid until: Cloud-Init sets the real KeePass-managed credential.
        Not stored in KeePass; not persisted after the spawn session.

      **WAN mode — Headscale tailnet (cross-network broodling):**
        The spawn package contains the Headscale auth key and server URL.
        The broodling's `phase-00a` (runs before hardware pre-flight) installs
        Tailscale and registers with the hatchery's Headscale:
          `curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh`
          `tailscale up --authkey {key} --login-server {headscale_url}`
        Broodling appears on the tailnet → hatchery SSHes to its tailnet IP exactly
        as in LAN mode (temporary root password, same mechanism):
          `python3 spawn_hardware_discovery.py --host {tailnet-ip} --password-prompt`
        No port forwarding required. The WireGuard tunnel is the transport;
        the temporary root password is still the authentication.
        After spawn completes, Tailscale remains — the broodling is a permanent
        tailnet member. Its tailnet IP is recorded in bootstrap-state.json.

      **Interactive mode:** no hardware discovery on the hatchery is needed.
        spawn.sh discovers hardware locally on the broodling at runtime.
        In WAN mode, phase-00a (Tailscale join) still runs first so the hatchery
        can reach the broodling for any follow-up coordination.

      Discovery output is embedded in autonomous spawn packages so phase-00 can
      reference disk IDs and NIC layout without re-running discovery on the broodling.

- [x] 12.E.5: **Spawn IaC and config generator** — from `spawn-plan-{hostname}.json`:
      - OpenTofu `.auto.tfvars` for this host's VM set
      - Cloud-Init snippets with this host's allocated IPs (from spawn plan, not hatchery IPs)
      - Ansible inventory additions (this host appended to existing groups)
      - k3s join token embedded in Ansible role vars (from spawn manifest)

- [x] 12.E.6: **Spawn scripts** — generated shell scripts using the same
      checkpoint/failure-package/workbook-update library as recovery scripts.
      All scripts read from spawn-plan.json; bridge names, pool names, and IPs
      are consistent across phases because phase-00 creates what later phases reference.

      - `spawn.sh` — orchestrated entry point; runs all phases in order

      *Host-level phases (Proxmox host must be configured before VMs can exist):*

      - `phase-00-host-bootstrap.sh` — two sub-stages, always in order:

        **Sub-stage A: Hardware pre-flight (read-only, no changes made)**
        Re-scans the broodling's actual hardware and compares against the embedded
        `hardware-profile.json` and `spawn-plan.json`. This catches any divergence
        between what was discovered on the hatchery and what is actually present now.
        Checks (all must pass before sub-stage B runs):
          - Disk IDs in spawn plan exist on this host and have the expected capacity
          - NIC names/MACs match the embedded hardware profile
            (Proxmox can renumber NICs after kernel updates or hardware changes)
          - Available RAM ≥ sum of VM RAM in spawn plan + 10% host overhead
          - No existing ZFS pool with a name that conflicts with the planned pool
          - No existing network bridge with a name that conflicts with the plan
          - Conflict re-validation: re-runs validate-spawn.py against spawn-manifest.json
            (catches any hatchery reservations made between package generation and now)
        On any mismatch: generates a failure package with a clear "hardware mismatch"
        or "stale manifest" diagnosis, prints the diff, and exits without making
        any changes to the broodling. The operator re-runs discovery on the hatchery
        and regenerates the spawn package.
        On pass: proceeds to sub-stage B.

        **Sub-stage B: Host configuration (writes config, creates pool, activates network)**
        Must run before any VM creation because VMs reference bridges and datastores
        that only exist after this stage:
          set hostname + fix /etc/hosts (pvecm add fails if hostname → 127.0.0.1)
          write bridge definitions to /etc/network/interfaces (per NIC layout in plan)
          ifreload -a to activate bridges without full reboot
          zpool create per plan topology (disk IDs confirmed by pre-flight)
          pvesm add zfspool to register pool as Proxmox datastore
          configure apt repos (no-subscription or enterprise)
        Output: Proxmox host ready to accept VM provisioning and cluster join.

      - `phase-01-join-proxmox.sh` — `pvecm add <hatchery-address>` using Proxmox cluster
        join address and fingerprint from spawn manifest; idempotent (detects if
        already a member). New host now visible in Proxmox datacenter.

      *VM provisioning phases (depend on phase-00 bridge/datastore names existing):*

      - `phase-02-vms.sh` — `tofu apply` using tfvars from spawn plan; bridge
        names and datastore names in tfvars match what phase-00 created exactly.

      - `phase-03-cloudinit.sh` — install generated Cloud-Init snippets (user-data,
        network-config, vendor-data) into Proxmox snippet store on this host;
        start VMs; poll SSH readiness for each VM before proceeding.

      *Cluster join phases (depend on VMs running):*

      - `phase-04-join-k3s.sh` — run Ansible k3s-server or k3s-worker role against
        the new VMs using join token from spawn manifest; selects correct token type
        (worker or server) based on spawn plan role.

      - `phase-05-promote-ha.sh` (conditional) — SQLite → embedded etcd migration;
        only generated when this broodling creates the 3rd k3s server node. Existing
        hatchery cluster is quiesced, etcd promoted, control plane distributed. If this phase
        is not needed, it is omitted from the package entirely.

      - `phase-06-verify.sh` — cluster health check (all nodes Ready, all VMs
        running), re-runs conflict validator against live Proxmox and k3s state
        as final confirmation. Failure here generates a failure package.

      *[Automatic after phase-06 — no further operator action:]*
      *Flux CD detects new k3s nodes, schedules workloads per anti-affinity rules.*
      *Assessment Engine detects broodling in Proxmox API, updates scores.*
      *Documentation Engine regenerates topology with broodling included.*

- [x] 12.E.7: **Spawn package assembler** (`proxmox-bootstrap/assemble-spawn-package.py`) —
      bundles spawn-manifest.json, spawn-plan-{hostname}.json, generated scripts,
      OpenTofu tfvars, Cloud-Init snippets, Ansible additions, spawn workbook HTML,
      and the shared script library into:
      `spawn-package-{cell_id}-{hostname}-{YYYY-MM-DD_HH_MM_SS}.tar.gz`
      The package is self-contained and offline-capable: the broodling does not need
      to reach the hatchery's API during execution.
      **The package never contains the KeePass database or any secret values.**
      It contains only KeePass secret paths (references). See AD-042.

- [x] 12.E.7a: **KeePass unlock gate in spawn.sh** — before any phase accesses secrets,
      `spawn.sh` prompts the operator to enter the KeePass master password and verifies
      it unlocks the operator's KeePass database (copied separately to the broodling or
      accessed via a known path). Scripts retrieve individual secrets programmatically
      from the unlocked database; no secret value is written to the broodling's disk in
      plain text. The gate runs regardless of execution mode (autonomous or interactive).
      In autonomous mode, this is the only prompt before fully automated execution.
      In interactive mode, this gate is followed by the service selection prompt.

- [x] 12.E.8: **Spawn workbook** (HTML) — embedded in the spawn package; tracks
      each phase with the same checkpoint/status/timestamp/validation pattern as
      the recovery workbook:
      - Sheets: Overview, Discovery, Storage, Network, Proxmox-Join, VMs, k3s-Join, Validation
      - Machine-updated by each spawn script phase
      - Spawn failure package generated automatically if any phase fails

- [x] 12.E.9: **Bootstrap-state.json updater** — runs on the hatchery after the
      broodling reports successful spawn (phase-08-verify.sh exits 0); merges the broodling's
      hardware profile, allocated VMIDs, IPs, hostnames, and cluster role into
      `bootstrap-state.json`; adds provenance records for new VMs; commits to Forgejo.
      Assessment Engine reassessment triggered automatically by Forgejo webhook.

- [x] 12.E.10: **Disposition-aware assessment scoring** — the Assessment Engine
      reads `disposition.services` from each host's entry in `bootstrap-state.json`
      and adjusts placement compliance evaluation to match declared intent:
      - Placement compliance is checked per service, per host: is this service
        running on the hosts that declared it in their disposition?
      - A node without `prometheus` in its service list is not penalized for
        missing a Prometheus replica
      - A node without `k3s-server` is not scored against HA control-plane
        distribution requirements
      - A node without `pbs-datastore` is not flagged for missing backup targets
      - The assessment report shows each host's `disposition.services` list
        alongside its scores — visible confirmation of what each node is expected
        to contribute and whether it is delivering
      - `disposition.excluded` (services that didn't fit at spawn time) is also
        shown, so the operator knows what was intentionally left out vs. what
        drifted away after deployment
      - A mismatch between `disposition.services` and observed reality remains a
        RED finding — disposition does not excuse services that were selected but
        are not running

- [x] 12.E.11: **Spawn scenarios tested:**
      - Baseline only (small machine): joins cluster, visible to assessment, no workloads
      - Compute disposition: k3s workers added, Flux schedules workloads
      - Storage disposition: PBS datastore added, Longhorn replicas
      - Control-plane disposition: HA promotion if 3rd server node
      - Mixed disposition (compute + storage): combined deployment
      - Hardware insufficient for selected flag: flag dropped with warning, rest proceeds
      - Full peer disposition: matches hatchery capabilities
      All scenarios use fixture hardware profiles. Conflict detection validated with
      deliberate VMID/IP/hostname collision fixtures.

- [x] 12.E.12: **Documentation:** `proxmox-bootstrap/NODE-SPAWNING.md` — operator
       runbook covering: prerequisites (bare Proxmox installed, SSH access),
       running hardware discovery on the broodling, selecting disposition interactively
       on the hatchery, reviewing the spawn plan's hardware fit assessment and warnings,
       copying and executing the spawn package on the broodling, verifying cluster
       health, and confirming `bootstrap-state.json` is updated with the broodling's
       disposition and state.

**Note on hardware heterogeneity:** The spawn planner explicitly does NOT require
identical hardware. A second host with 6 HDDs gets raidz1; the first host with
2 SSDs has a mirror. Both run the same VM roles and software stack. Only the
hardware adaptation layer (ZFS topology, NIC bridge config, VM sizing within
available RAM) differs between them.

**Note on Talos variant:** If `os_variant: talos` is declared for k3s-server nodes
(see Milestone 9.T), the spawn planner emits Talos machine configs instead of
Cloud-Init for server VMs on the broodling. The spawn plan records `os_variant`
per VM, matching the existing cluster's declared variant.

## Track 4 — Autonomous Operations

*Prerequisite: Tracks 1–3 complete. The assessment engine must be operational,
continuous assessment (Phase 24) running, and the digital twin current before
autonomous remediation can propose meaningful actions.*

### Design contract for autonomous remediation

The assessment engine has always surfaced gaps and scored them. Track 4 closes
the loop: from detection → proposal → human approval → execution → reassessment.

**The core constraint is this: remediation is proposed, not imposed.**
The system recommends; the operator approves; the system executes.
No autonomous action changes infrastructure state without a recorded human
approval. This constraint is not a configuration option — it is architectural.

**Scope of autonomous action.** The executor handles reversible, observable,
low-blast-radius operations. It explicitly does not handle:
- Destruction of data, VMs, volumes, or snapshots
- Changes to Proxmox cluster membership (those go through forge/spawn/phoenix flows)
- Modifications to authoritative metadata YAML files
- KeePass credential changes (those require the KeePass gate in an operator session)
- Network topology declaration changes (operators must update the source of truth)
- Any operation the operator has not explicitly approved in this session

Anything not on the allowed-action list is blocked at the executor layer,
regardless of what the planner proposes. An overly broad proposal is rejected
before it runs, not after.

---

### Phase 26 — Autonomous Remediation

*Closes the assess → detect → propose → approve → execute → reassess loop.*

**26.1 — Remediation Planner** (`proxmox-bootstrap/remediation_planner.py`)

Reads the current readiness report and twin state to produce a structured
`RemediationPlan`: an ordered list of `RemediationProposal` objects, each
with enough context for the operator to make an informed approval decision.

Each proposal records:
- `proposal_id` — stable UUID; survives across assessment cycles until resolved
- `issue_id` — references the specific gap or readiness finding that triggered it
- `severity` — mirrors the assessment score (YELLOW/ORANGE/RED) of the underlying issue
- `action_type` — enumerated type (see below); determines which executor handler runs
- `action_description` — human-readable "what will happen if you approve this"
- `target` — component, service name, or node hostname the action affects
- `dry_run_output` — what the action would produce, captured without making changes
- `reversibility` — `reversible` | `irreversible` | `manual-rollback`; RED is blocked unless reversible
- `estimated_duration_seconds` — from historical execution data
- `proposed_at` — UTC timestamp
- `prerequisite_ids` — other proposals that must execute successfully first

Allowed action types (exhaustive list — anything not here is rejected at the
executor):

| Action type | What it does | Reversibility |
|---|---|---|
| `restart-service` | `systemctl restart {svc}` on target VM | Reversible (stop again) |
| `run-backup` | `python3 run-backup.py --layer {layer}` | Reversible (restore from prior) |
| `renew-cert` | `certbot renew` or `acme.sh --renew` for near-expiry cert | Reversible (prior cert still valid) |
| `regenerate-phoenix` | Re-run phoenix playbook generator for stale node package | Reversible (old package kept) |
| `sync-cert-to-k8s` | Re-run `sync-cert-to-k8s.sh` to push renewed cert into cluster secrets | Reversible (old secret restored from cert) |
| `rotate-join-token` | Generate new k3s join token; update bootstrap-state.json | Manual rollback |
| `restart-assessment-timer` | `systemctl enable --now broodforge-operational.timer` | Reversible |
| `schedule-drill` | Append a drill reminder entry to bootstrap-state.json | Reversible (delete entry) |
| `flag-manual` | Mark a finding for manual operator attention; no system change | N/A |

The planner never proposes an action outside this list. Unknown findings produce
`flag-manual` proposals, never executable ones.

- [x] 26.1.1: `RemediationProposal` dataclass and schema additions to `bootstrap-state-schema.json`
- [x] 26.1.2: Planner logic — map each gap type to its allowed action type
- [x] 26.1.3: Dry-run execution for each action type (produces `dry_run_output` without making changes)
- [x] 26.1.4: Proposal deduplication — if an identical proposal already exists in the queue, update it rather than creating a duplicate
- [x] 26.1.5: Integration with `engine.py --mode operational` — proposals generated automatically at the end of each operational assessment run
- [x] 26.1.6: Tests (propose phase: 30+ cases covering all action types and edge cases)

**26.2 — Approval Queue** (`proxmox-bootstrap/remediation_queue.py`)

Manages the lifecycle of proposals from creation through execution.

State machine per proposal:
```
proposed → approved → executing → resolved
        ↘ rejected
        ↘ superseded   (newer proposal for same issue replaces this one)
        ↘ expired      (underlying issue resolved by other means before approval)
```

Queue storage: `remediations` array in `bootstrap-state.json`. Each entry persists
until resolved, rejected, or superseded. Queue is committed to Forgejo on every
state change so the record is version-controlled and auditable.

Approval record per transition:
- `approved_by` — operator identifier (hostname + Unix user, or dashboard session token)
- `approved_at` — UTC timestamp
- `approval_channel` — `cli` | `dashboard` | `auto-policy`
- `approval_note` — optional free-text comment from operator

Auto-approve policy (operator-configured, disabled by default):
- `auto_approve_threshold`: `null` (disabled) | `YELLOW` | `ORANGE`
- When set, proposals at or below the threshold are auto-approved on creation
- RED proposals are **never** auto-approved regardless of policy
- `irreversible` proposals are **never** auto-approved regardless of policy
- Auto-approvals are recorded with `approval_channel: auto-policy`

- [x] 26.2.1: Queue data model — `RemediationQueue`, state machine transitions, storage in bootstrap-state.json
- [x] 26.2.2: CLI for queue management (`python3 proxmox-bootstrap/remediation-cli.py`):
  - `list` — show pending proposals with dry-run summary
  - `approve {id}` — approve a single proposal
  - `approve-all --severity YELLOW` — batch approve by max severity
  - `reject {id} [--reason text]` — reject a proposal
  - `dry-run {id}` — re-run dry-run and display output
  - `history` — show resolved/rejected proposals
- [x] 26.2.3: Auto-approve policy configuration (stored in `bootstrap-state.json remediation_policy`)
- [x] 26.2.4: Proposal expiry — if the underlying issue is no longer present in the assessment, mark proposal as `expired` rather than leaving it in the queue
- [x] 26.2.5: Tests (queue lifecycle: 25+ cases)

**26.3 — Executor** (`proxmox-bootstrap/remediation_executor.py`)

Executes approved proposals with the same checkpoint and failure-package semantics
as spawn/forge/phoenix scripts.

Execution contract:
1. **Re-validate** the proposal before running: confirm the underlying issue still
   exists and the action type is still on the allowed list. Cancel if either check fails.
2. **Record the start** in bootstrap-state.json (status → `executing`, `started_at`).
3. **Dry-run first** — re-run dry-run and diff against the original. If significantly
   different, pause and surface for re-approval rather than proceeding.
4. **Execute** the action.
5. **Checkpoint** at each meaningful step (mirrors spawn checkpoint pattern).
6. On failure: generate a `RemediationFailurePackage` (same structure as spawn failure
   packages) and set status to `failed`. Never silently swallow errors.
7. On success: record `resolved_at`, `outcome`, and transition to `resolved`.
8. **Trigger reassessment** — queue a fresh operational assessment run so the twin
   reflects the post-remediation state.

KeePass gate: any action that requires secrets (e.g. `rotate-join-token`,
`run-backup`) requires the KeePass gate to be unlocked for that session. The
executor checks for the gate before starting; if not unlocked, it suspends
execution and prompts via `/dev/tty` — it never starts a secrets-accessing action
unattended.

- [x] 26.3.1: `RemediationExecutor` class — pre-validate, checkpoint, execute, post-record
- [x] 26.3.2: Handler per action type (one function per allowed action type from 26.1)
- [x] 26.3.3: KeePass gate integration — suspend if gate not unlocked for secrets-requiring actions
- [x] 26.3.4: `RemediationFailurePackage` — extends failure package format from spawn
- [x] 26.3.5: Post-execution reassessment trigger
- [x] 26.3.6: Tests (executor: 35+ cases, all action types + failure paths)

**26.4 — Dashboard Integration**

Expose the remediation queue in the broodforge sidecar dashboard (`broodforge_dashboard.py`)
so operators can review and approve proposals from the browser.

New endpoints:
- `GET /api/remediations` — list proposals (filterable by status and severity)
- `GET /api/remediations/{id}` — full proposal detail including dry-run output
- `POST /api/remediations/{id}/approve` — approve (requires `X-Broodforge-Token` header)
- `POST /api/remediations/{id}/reject` — reject with optional reason
- `POST /api/remediations/approve-batch` — approve multiple by severity threshold

Dashboard HTML additions:
- New **Remediations** section in the main dashboard page
- Pending proposals listed with: severity badge, action description, target, dry-run summary, approve/reject buttons
- Executed history section showing resolved and failed proposals
- Auto-approve policy display and toggle

Token requirement: all POST endpoints require the `X-Broodforge-Token` header
(already enforced for `analyze-failures`). A proposal approved from the dashboard
records `approval_channel: dashboard`.

- [x] 26.4.1: `GET /api/remediations` and `GET /api/remediations/{id}` endpoints
- [x] 26.4.2: `POST` approval/rejection endpoints with token gate
- [x] 26.4.3: Dashboard HTML section — proposal cards with approve/reject buttons
- [x] 26.4.4: Batch approve endpoint with severity filter
- [x] 26.4.5: Tests (dashboard endpoints: 15+ cases)

**26.5 — Feedback Loop and Reporting**

Close the loop: verify that approved remediations actually resolved the issue,
and surface the closed-loop record in operational reports.

- `RemediationRecord` — links a proposal, its execution result, and the post-execution
  assessment delta (was the gap actually closed?)
- Operational Report (Section 8 — new) — Remediation Summary:
  - Pending proposals awaiting approval (count by severity)
  - Recently executed proposals (last 30 days) with outcomes
  - Failed remediations requiring operator attention
  - Issues that were auto-approved and resolved without intervention
  - Issues that resisted remediation (executed but issue persists after reassessment)

- [x] 26.5.1: `RemediationRecord` — execution + post-assessment delta + closed-loop status
- [x] 26.5.2: Operational report Section 8 — Remediation Summary renderer
- [x] 26.5.3: HTML operational report update — Section 8 added to `html_operational_report.py`
- [x] 26.5.4: `resists_remediation` flag — if an action executed successfully but the
  underlying issue is still present in the next assessment, the proposal is marked
  `resisted` and escalated to the operator
- [x] 26.5.5: Tests (feedback loop: 20+ cases)

**26.6 — Policy Engine and Federation Remediation**

*Advanced optional sub-phase.*

**Policy engine** (`proxmox-bootstrap/remediation_policy.py`):
Fine-grained control over what can be auto-approved, what requires human approval,
and what is blocked entirely. Per-action-type overrides supplement the global
severity threshold.

Policy fields (stored in `bootstrap-state.json remediation_policy`):
- `auto_approve_threshold`: global max severity for auto-approval (default: null)
- `blocked_action_types`: list of action types that are always blocked regardless of approval
- `require_approval_action_types`: action types always requiring approval even if under threshold
- `max_concurrent_executions`: number of proposals that can execute simultaneously (default: 1)
- `execution_window`: time-of-day window when executions may run (cron-style expression)
- `notify_on_proposal`: emit a structured log event when new proposals are generated
- `notify_on_approval`: emit a structured log event when proposals are approved
- `notify_on_outcome`: emit a structured log event when proposals complete or fail

**Federation remediation**:
A federated remediation proposal is one that requires coordination across cells.
Example: Cell A's backup is failing because Cell B (the backup destination) is
full. The proposal must be visible to operators of both cells; approval from
the "owning cell" operator is required before execution.

Cross-cell proposals are stored in the federation state (Phase 19) alongside the
originating cell's bootstrap-state.json. The federation runbook (Phase 20) gains a
"Pending Remediations" section.

- [x] 26.6.1: `RemediationPolicy` dataclass and schema; CLI to update policy
- [x] 26.6.2: Execution window enforcement (don't execute outside configured hours)
- [x] 26.6.3: Concurrent execution limit (serialize by default; operator can allow parallel)
- [x] 26.6.4: Cross-cell proposal format — `owning_cell_id`, `requires_cell_approval[]`
- [x] 26.6.5: Federation remediation view in Federation Workbook (Phase 20 extension)
- [x] 26.6.6: Tests (policy engine: 20+ cases; cross-cell: 10+ cases)

**26.7 — Fully Autonomous Mode** *(optional — must be explicitly enabled by an operator)*

An opt-in execution mode in which the assessment engine detects issues, the
planner generates proposals, and the executor runs them without waiting for
per-action approval. The gated model (Phase 26.1–26.6) remains the default and
is always available regardless of whether this mode is active.

**This mode exists for operators who are comfortable with the bounded action
list and want the platform to self-maintain without manual intervention on
routine maintenance tasks.** It is not the right mode for initial deployment,
unstable environments, or any cell where operator oversight of each change is
required.

*Autonomous mode never changes which actions are possible — only who initiates
execution. The bounded action-type list, the hard exclusions, and the full audit
trail from Phases 26.1–26.6 apply without exception.*

---

**Enabling ceremony — two-step confirmation required**

Autonomous mode cannot be turned on by editing a config file directly. It
requires a deliberate interactive ceremony so the operator understands exactly
what they are enabling before it takes effect:

```
$ python3 proxmox-bootstrap/remediation-cli.py enable-autonomous

Current policy review
=====================
Cell:            proxmox-cell-a
Assessment:      operational (running every 1 hour)
Pending queue:   3 proposals awaiting approval
Action types in scope for autonomous execution:
  restart-service, run-backup, renew-cert, regenerate-phoenix,
  sync-cert-to-k8s, restart-assessment-timer, schedule-drill
Maximum severity for autonomous execution: ORANGE
Execution window: any time (no restriction)

HARD EXCLUSIONS — these are NEVER executed autonomously regardless of policy:
  ✗ Any action with reversibility: irreversible
  ✗ RED-severity findings
  ✗ Actions requiring KeePass gate (those remain per-action gated)
  ✗ Cross-cell actions (those remain per-cell-operator gated)

What will happen if you continue:
  Approved: new proposals at or below ORANGE will execute automatically
            on the next assessment cycle after they are proposed.
  NOT approved: the 3 existing proposals in the queue still require
                per-action approval — autonomous mode applies to new proposals
                generated after this point, not retroactively.

This mode will auto-disable after 30 days (2026-07-02) unless renewed.
To disable at any time: remediation-cli.py disable-autonomous

Type 'enable autonomous' to confirm, or Ctrl-C to cancel:
> _
```

The confirmation phrase must be typed exactly. A mistype aborts with no change.
After confirmation the mode is recorded in `bootstrap-state.json` with:
- `enabled_by` — Unix user + hostname at enable time
- `enabled_at` — UTC timestamp
- `enabled_via` — `cli` | `dashboard`
- `expires_at` — UTC timestamp (default 30 days; configurable; null = no expiry)
- `scope` — the exact policy in effect at enable time (snapshot)

The operator is shown a summary of the enabling record before the prompt
returns, confirming what was stored.

---

**Hard exclusions — enforced at the executor layer, not by policy**

These restrictions cannot be overridden by any policy setting. They are checked
inside the executor before any autonomous execution begins:

| Exclusion | Reason |
|---|---|
| `reversibility: irreversible` actions | Cannot be undone if the assessment was wrong |
| RED-severity findings | The system should not self-heal critical failures without a human confirming the diagnosis |
| KeePass-gated actions | Unattended secrets access requires a separate unlock mechanism not yet implemented; these remain per-action gated in all modes |
| Actions affecting more than one cell | Cross-cell blast radius requires coordinated approval |
| Actions on a cell whose last assessment is older than 2× the assessment interval | Stale state means the proposal may be based on outdated information |
| Actions during an active reconstruction drill | Do not remediate a cell that is deliberately in a degraded state for testing |

---

**Scope constraints — set at enable time**

The operator can restrict autonomous mode to a subset of actions and severity
levels at enable time. Restrictions are stored in the enabling record and cannot
be loosened without re-running the enabling ceremony.

| Constraint | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `autonomous_action_types` | All safe types | List of action types that may execute autonomously; `rotate-join-token` excluded from default |
| `autonomous_max_severity` | `ORANGE` | Maximum severity level; cannot be set to `RED` |
| `autonomous_execution_window` | Any time | Cron-style expression restricting when executions may run |
| `autonomous_max_concurrent` | 1 | How many proposals may execute in parallel |
| `autonomous_expires_at` | 30 days | UTC timestamp after which mode auto-disables; `null` = no expiry |
| `autonomous_notify` | `true` | Emit a structured log event for every autonomous execution |

---

**Notifications — what happens without per-action approval**

Because the operator is not involved in each action, the platform must report
what it did. Every autonomous execution emits a structured notification event
that the operator can consume via:
- The dashboard **Remediation History** view (always)
- The operational report Section 8 "Autonomous Executions" subsection (always)
- SMTP email (if external SMTP dependency configured in bootstrap-state.json)
- A structured log entry in the systemd journal (always; can be monitored by any log aggregator)

The notification includes: what issue was detected, what action ran, what changed,
the outcome (success/failed/resisted), and the next scheduled reassessment time.

If an autonomous execution fails or a remediated issue persists after reassessment
(`resisted`), the finding is escalated: an immediate notification is sent and the
specific proposal is moved back to the `gated` approval mode until the operator
reviews it. Repeated failures disable autonomous mode for that action type
automatically.

---

**Disabling autonomous mode**

Autonomous mode can be disabled at any time with no confirmation required:

```
$ python3 proxmox-bootstrap/remediation-cli.py disable-autonomous
[remediation] Autonomous mode disabled.
[remediation] Proposals in queue: 2 now require per-action approval.
[remediation] Disable recorded: 2026-06-15T14:22:00Z by root@hatchery
```

Or from the dashboard via the "Disable autonomous mode" button (no confirmation
prompt in the UI — disabling is always safe and immediate).

Auto-disable triggers (without operator action):
- `expires_at` timestamp reached
- N consecutive failed executions (configurable; default: 3)
- N consecutive `resisted` outcomes (configurable; default: 2 for the same issue)
- Cell readiness drops to RED (the platform self-demotes out of autonomous mode
  when the cell is in a critical state)

Every auto-disable event is logged with the triggering reason and sent as a
high-priority notification.

---

**Dashboard integration**

New elements in `broodforge_dashboard.py`:
- Prominent **autonomous mode status badge** in the topbar: `AUTO` (green) when enabled, `GATED` (muted) when not
- **Enable/Disable** button in the Remediations section (Enable requires a confirmation modal that mirrors the CLI ceremony; Disable is immediate)
- **Autonomous executions** subsection in Remediation History — separate from the manual-approval history
- **Scope display** — shows the exact constraints in effect when autonomous mode is enabled
- **Auto-disable countdown** — shows time remaining until expiry if `expires_at` is set

---

- [x] 26.7.1: `autonomous_mode` field group in `bootstrap-state-schema.json` and `RemediationPolicy`
- [x] 26.7.2: Enabling ceremony in `remediation-cli.py` — two-step confirmation, scope review, enabling record
- [x] 26.7.3: Executor integration — skip approval-wait step for in-scope proposals when autonomous mode is active
- [x] 26.7.4: Hard exclusion enforcement in executor — checked independently of policy
- [x] 26.7.5: Auto-disable triggers (expiry, consecutive failures, RED cell state)
- [x] 26.7.6: Notification events — structured log + SMTP if configured + dashboard update
- [x] 26.7.7: Dashboard — autonomous mode badge, enable/disable controls, scope display, auto-disable countdown
- [x] 26.7.8: Stale-state guard — refuse autonomous execution if last assessment is older than 2× interval
- [x] 26.7.9: Drill guard — refuse autonomous execution while a reconstruction drill is active
- [x] 26.7.10: Tests:
      - Enabling ceremony: confirmation phrase correct/wrong/abort
      - Hard exclusions: RED, irreversible, KeePass-gated, stale-state, drill-active all blocked
      - Scope constraints: action type filter, severity cap, execution window
      - Auto-disable: expiry, consecutive failures, RED cell state
      - Notification events: structured log fields, SMTP trigger conditions
      - Re-enable after auto-disable: ceremony required again
      *(40+ test cases)*

---

**Gate:** Phase 26 completion (including 26.7) adds the full autonomous action layer.
Phases 26.1–26.6 deliver human-gated remediation. Phase 26.7 adds fully autonomous
execution as an explicit opt-in on top of that foundation.

**Track 4 begins after Track 3. No Track 4 phase requires any Track 4 prerequisite
beyond a working Phase 24 (continuous assessment) deployment.**

---

## Design Principles

1. **Reconstruction is the objective.** Every state category, metadata field, and
   documentation artifact is evaluated against: "Does this enable reconstruction
   from repository state after complete infrastructure loss?"

2. **Documentation is generated, not authored.** Technical infrastructure information
   is collected automatically. Operators provide only what cannot be discovered.

3. **Cell scope is universal.** `cell_id` is mandatory on every state document.
   No single-environment assumptions anywhere in the data model.

4. **The Digital Twin is the source of truth.** All outputs derive from the twin.

5. **Recovery relationships are explicit.** Which cell holds what for whom is
   declared and verified, not assumed.

6. **Missing information is surfaced, never silently omitted.** UNRESOLVED and
   STALE fields are always visible with reason, impact, and remediation guidance.

7. **Trust is declared and verified.** Inter-cell trust has expiry, is verified at
   Tier 3 assessment, and expired trust degrades federation readiness scores.

8. **Historical snapshots are reproducible.** Same twin state always produces same outputs.

9. **Readiness scoring is honest.** RED means recovery will likely fail.

10. **Single-cell work must be federation-ready from the start.** `cell_id` in all
    schemas. Recovery playbooks organized by cell. Documentation scoped by cell.
    The federation layer is added above, not retrofitted below.

11. **Remediation is proposed, not imposed.** The assessment engine recommends;
    the operator approves; the system executes. No autonomous action changes
    infrastructure state without a recorded human approval. This is an
    architectural constraint, not a configuration option.
