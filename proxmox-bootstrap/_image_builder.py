_image_builder.py — Pre-install bootstrap image builder (Phase 1.H, AD-057).

Builds a "bootstrap image staging bundle" — a structured tar.gz that documents
and stages exactly what an operator would combine with the official Proxmox VE
ISO via their own remastering process to produce bootable pre-install media.

This module does NOT download, mount, or repack a real Proxmox ISO (no network
access, no source ISO available in this environment — and broodforge does not
redistribute Proxmox's installer media). Instead it produces the *staging
content* an operator overlays onto that ISO: an `answer.toml` (Proxmox 8+
automated-installer answer file, derived from forge-manifest.json so the
operator answers setup questions exactly once — AD-049), the assembled forge
package (reusing `assemble_forge_package`), a first-boot systemd hook that
runs the embedded forge package's `forge.sh` automatically, an installer
script for that hook, and a README documenting the manual remastering steps.

This mirrors how `assemble_forge_package` builds a tar.gz describing *its*
artifact rather than a literal physical thing — the bundle here is the
equivalent staging artifact for pre-install media.

to rotate via the KeePass-managed credential the forge package installs; it is
never written to KeePass and is printed once, at build time, for the operator
to note down.

# Bootstrap Image Staging Bundle — {cell_id}

## What this bundle is — and is NOT

This is a **staging bundle**, not a bootable ISO. broodforge cannot download,
mount, or remaster the official Proxmox VE installer image in this environment
(no network access at build time, and broodforge does not redistribute
Proxmox's media). What you have here is everything *specific to your cell*
that needs to be combined with the official Proxmox VE ISO:

- `answer.toml`           — Proxmox 8+ automated-installer answer file, derived
                            from your forge-manifest.json (network, hostname,
                            disk layout, timezone — answered once, here)
- `forge-package.tar.gz`  — the full forge package for this cell (same artifact
                            FORGING.md Step 2 produces — embedded so the new
                            host can forge itself without a second copy step)
- `first-boot/`           — a systemd oneshot unit + installer script that runs
                            the embedded forge package's forge.sh automatically
                            on the new host's first boot
- `bootstrap-image-manifest.{{json,html}}` — hash/contents manifest for this bundle

## How to build bootable media from this bundle (operator-performed)

Proxmox publishes an "Automated Installation" guide describing how to combine
an `answer.toml` with the official ISO — either by mounting the ISO, copying
`answer.toml` to its root, and re-packing it (`xorriso`/`proxmox-auto-install-assistant`),
or by preparing a USB stick with the answer file alongside the ISO image. That
process is **the operator's responsibility** and uses Proxmox's own tooling —
broodforge does not (and, offline, cannot) perform it for you. The high-level
steps, per Proxmox's documentation:

1. Download the official Proxmox VE ISO for your target version.
2. Use `proxmox-auto-install-assistant prepare-iso <iso> --fetch-from iso
   --answer-file answer.toml` (or the equivalent partition-overlay method for
   USB media) to produce bootable media that boots straight into the
   automated installer using the answer file in this bundle.
3. After the automated install completes and the host reboots into Proxmox,
   run `install-first-boot-hook.sh` (from `first-boot/`) — Proxmox's
   `[first-boot]` post-install hook in `answer.toml` can invoke it directly,
   or you can run it manually once, before the first reboot.
4. On first real boot, `{FIRST_BOOT_SERVICE_NAME}` runs the embedded
   `forge.sh` unattended — turning "bare metal → operational hatchery" into a
   boot-and-walk-away operation (the same 8 phases FORGING.md Step 5 documents).

## IMPORTANT — about the root password in answer.toml

`answer.toml`'s `root-password` is a **freshly-generated, single-use discovery
passphrase** (the same temporary-credential pattern Cloud-Init uses for spawned
nodes, AD-039/AD-043) — NOT a permanent credential, and NOT stored in KeePass.
It exists only to satisfy the installer's requirement for a root password and
to allow the embedded forge package to bootstrap itself. The forge package's
phase-03 replaces it with a KeePass-managed credential during the automated
forge run. **Note the passphrase down before burning this bundle to media —
you will not be able to recover it from this bundle afterward — and treat it
as compromised/discard it once forging completes.**

## This is an OPTIONAL alternative path

The supported baseline remains: install Proxmox VE yourself (any way you like
— official installer, hosting-provider imaging, an existing cluster), then
follow FORGING.md from Step 1. This bundle only collapses the "install Proxmox"
+ "copy package" + "SSH in and run forge.sh" steps into one boot. See
FORGING.md "Step 0 — Build pre-install media (optional)" for the full picture.
