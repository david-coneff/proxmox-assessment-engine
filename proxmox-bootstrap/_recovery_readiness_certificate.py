_recovery_readiness_certificate.py — Recovery-Readiness Conformance Certificate
builder (Phase 1.I, AD-059).

Composes one timestamped, generated record — `recovery-readiness-certificate.json`
(+ HTML, AD-051 pattern) — out of evidence broodforge already produces:

  - manifest_hash   SHA-256 over the canonical (sorted-keys JSON) serialization
                    of the manifest broodforge collected for this cell
  - graph_hash      SHA-256 over the canonical form of the dependency graph
                    `doc-gen/dependencies.py::build_graph` derives from it
  - readiness       the real `ReadinessReport` signal from `doc-gen/readiness.py`
                    (overall_score / overall_score_reason / a components summary)
  - drift           a summary (severity + diff counts) of the latest drift record
                    from `doc-gen/drift.py::compute_drift`
  - latest_drill    a summary of the most recent reconstruction drill
                    (`proxmox-bootstrap/reconstruction_drill.py::DrillRecord`)

AD-059 names this "the one genuinely new artifact worth drafting" — a
Deployment-Certificate-shaped bundle that says "as of this run, here is the
evidence that this cell could recover, and here is what it was declared to
be," built as an *additive composition* of existing modules — no new scoring
system, no Ed25519/category-theoretic apparatus (explicitly out of scope).

CORRECTION TO AD-059's PREMISE (documented here deliberately — see also
FEATURE-HISTORY.md): AD-059's text describes "RRS/ACS/DCS/CRS/OSS scores
already in readiness.py." That is aspirational, not actual — `readiness.py`'s
`score_graph()` produces a single `overall_score` (GREEN/YELLOW/ORANGE/RED/
BLOCKED) plus `overall_score_reason` and a `components` list; the five-letter
abbreviation scheme appears only in `proxmox-bootstrap/broodforge_dashboard.py`
as defensive UI code reading a `scores`/`summary` dict that nothing populates.
This certificate composes the *real* signal — `overall_score` /
`overall_score_reason` / a per-score-level component count — rather than
inventing or perpetuating the five-category fiction.

Stdlib only.
