# proxmox-bootstrap — Bootstrap State Repository

This repository is the **Bootstrap State** for an Infrastructure Cell. It tracks
all assets required to provision VMs from a freshly installed Proxmox host to a state
where Ansible can manage them.

Cell ID: `proxmox-cell-a`

---

## What Is Tracked Here

| Asset | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud-Init user-data | `snippets/user-data/` | Initial user, SSH keys, packages, hostname |
| Cloud-Init network-config | `snippets/network-config/` | Static IP assignment on first boot |
| Cloud-Init vendor-data | `snippets/vendor-data/` | Proxmox-specific first-boot hooks |
| Base image registry | `images/registry.yaml` | ISO checksums, download URLs, template names |
| VM template manifests | `templates/` | What is in each Proxmox VM template |
| Deployment provenance | `provenance/` | Build receipts per VM deployment |
| Secret registry | `secret-registry.yaml` | KeePass path references — never values |
| DNS registry | `dns-registry.yaml` | Hostname-to-IP mappings for all VMs |
| Service contracts | `service-contracts/` | Interfaces provided/required per service |
| Bootstrap state manifest | `bootstrap-state.json` | Machine-readable aggregation of all the above |
| Hardware requirements | embedded in `bootstrap-state.json` | BIOS flags required before Proxmox install |

## Usage

This repository is read by:
- `assessment/tier2/collectors/bootstrap_state.py` — Tier 2 assessment verifies
  deployed snippet hashes match this repository's state
- `doc-gen/engine.py` — Documentation generator reads this to pre-populate commands
  with actual IPs (from dns-registry), actual snippet paths, actual secret KeePass
  paths (from secret-registry)

Snippet content must match what is uploaded to Proxmox snippet storage.
Use `pvesm` or the Proxmox UI to upload snippets from `snippets/`.

---

## Design Constraints

- This repository never stores secret values — only KeePass path references
- Every VM provisioned from this cell must have an entry in `snippets/`,
  `dns-registry.yaml`, and `secret-registry.yaml`
- Provenance records are written at deployment time by the deployment operator or
  by the OpenTofu/Ansible pipeline
- `bootstrap-state.json` is the machine-readable aggregation — update it whenever
  any file in this repository changes

## File Naming Convention

Python files in this directory follow a two-file pattern for CLI entry points:

| Style | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Hyphenated** | `collect-tier2.py` | Shell-invocable entry point — called from scripts and cron |
| **Underscored** | `collect_tier2.py` | Importable Python module — contains all logic |

Python cannot import modules with hyphens in their names (`import collect-tier2` is a
syntax error), so the hyphenated file is a minimal wrapper that does nothing except call
`from collect_tier2 import main`. All logic lives in the underscored module.

Pairs using this pattern:
- `collect-tier2.py` / `collect_tier2.py`
- `forge-planner.py` / `forge_planner.py`
- `spawn-planner.py` / `spawn_planner.py`
- `phoenix-planner.py` / `phoenix_guided_setup.py`

Single-file CLIs (no importable counterpart): `validate-metadata.py`, `suggest-names.py`,
`generate-setup-manifest.py`, `generate-network-configs.py`, `generate-user-data.py`.
