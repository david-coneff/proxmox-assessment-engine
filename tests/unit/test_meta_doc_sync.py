"""Assert that broodforge's own governing docs (ROADMAP, ARCHITECTURE) carry
the same Version/Date stamp in both their Markdown source and their hand-styled
HTML companion.

broodforge's product generates drift reports for the infrastructure it manages
(doc-gen/drift.py) — but its own meta-documentation has no equivalent check,
so a Markdown edit routinely lands without its HTML counterpart being touched
(observed: ROADMAP.html and docs/ARCHITECTURE.html both several days stale
relative to their .md sources as of 2026-06-07). This test is broodforge's
"trigger" for keeping its own docs honest: it fails the moment one half of a
pair is updated without the other, the same way test_html_base_sync.py catches
drift between the two copies of html_base.py."""
